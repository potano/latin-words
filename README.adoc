= William Whitaker's Words
A Latin-word parser and dictionary with an English-to-Latin mode.

The _WORDS_ program has been of considerable interest to Latin students
and scholars since it was introduced in the 1990's.  It is a console-mode
program with a simple interface:  type in a Latin word, press Enter, and
see an analysis of the word's function and a listing of the word's meanings.

Given its simple user interface and its being written in a highly portable
programming language, the _WORDS_ program runs on many operating systems
and machine architectures.

The program outlived its author, Col. William Whitaker (USAF), who died
in 2010. Though the program is complicated and is accompanied by several
tools that aid in updating the data files for new words and parsing forms,
the instructions he wrote for building the program are easy to follow and
produce good work with little effort--even more than a decade after the
author's death.

A web search reveals several sites where the sources of the WORDS program
are available.  The current repository differs from those in that it
presents a history of Col. Whitaker's work on the project as I could glean
from files the Wayback Machine spidered from the product's website
(http://users.erols.com/whitaker) plus files I downloaded from the site
while the project was still active.  The history is presented as a series
of Git commits.  Included in this repository:

. Updates to the HTML pages as they were made on project's website.  The Git
commit timestamps for these are generally the same as the times the Wayback
Machine spidered them, not the actual times they were uploaded.

. Source-code-file revisions for the main WORDS program and supplemental
tools.  The Git-commit timestamps are those recorded in the metadata of the
respective ZIP files which contain them (_wordsall.zip_ and _tools.zip_).

. Augmentation of Col. Whitaker's version-numbering scheme to account for
the fact that he sometimes released multiple versions without changing the
version number.  All the available source-code releases are tagged in the
Git repo with these augmented version-numbers.

. An autoconf-generated configure script that works with all seven source
versions in the repo.  The resulting Makefiles handle the variances among
the program's versions and in the build-host environment.

. Patches which correct a few runtime bugs--some platform-specific, some
version-specific.  The Makefile applies these patches at build time; the
original sources remain unaltered.

. Installation instructions that cover many Linux and BSD distros plus
Microsoft Windows.  All seven versions of WORDS have been tested and run
successfully on all the systems where instructions are given.

This repo aimed at two main audiences:

* Software-package maintainers who prepare packages for Linux or BSD
distributions or Microsoft Windows.

* Developers wishing to explore the history of the WORDS project on the way
to developing future versions.

Though the latest version needs no source-code patches, it does need an
adjustment of line endings in its data files when deployed on Unix systems.
The Makefile accounts for this.  In addition, the Makefile is friendly to
GNU tooling.

The `configure` script is committed to the first version of the main branch
so as to make it available to all the versions in the repo.

A source tarball with the most recent release is posted to Github along with
a Gentoo ebuild for the same release.

== Background

William Whitaker was a colonel in the U.S. Air Force.
He chaired the DARPA working group that managed the effort that resulted in
the specification and initial development of the Ada programming language.
Col. Whitaker also had a strong interest in the Latin language.
After he retired, he wrote _WORDS_ using his new programming language to
help him understand the ancient language he long admired.

As is often the case among software developers, he found his project
to be useful and went on to make it available to others.

The program bears several marks of a personal project, especially one
starting more than 20 years ago.

* It was written for his own consumption: everything he did in the project
lives in pretty much the same directory where he edited the source files,
built the program, and ran it.
Indeed, he likely used DOS, which has no concept of users and permissions.
Filename extensions are never longer than three characters.

* Tools we consider commonplace today either didn't exist on the systems to
which he had access or were rudimentary: revision-control systems, _make_,
text-file processors, and testing frameworks, among others.
The World Wide Web was in its infancy.

* Some data files have what remains of last-sector padding with ^Z
characters, a vestige of CP/M.

* Version numbers were fluid: he often announced changes, including
impactful ones, which resulted in no change in version.

* He was unconcerned with license texts; he asserted a copyright but
dedicated his work to the public domain.

Through it all, though, he was generous with his time and quick to answer
people's questions and address problems. He took pains to credit work
that was not his own. He delighted in every new port of his program to a
new system.

Indeed, when I encountered his program in 2000 I found it very easy to build
and run on my operating system of choice at the time, OS/2.
I interacted with him a couple of years later when I built a new version
and posted the binary to an OS/2 download site.
He graciously posted a link to my work and included my OS-specific page on
his website.

== Version history

Version numbers are a Big Deal. They help users, developers, and
distributors know where they are when they track down an issue.
Linux distributions, in particular, use version numbers to make
decisions of the stability of a given package.

Any version history of _WORDS_ has to be reconstructed.
Col. Whitaker made no mention of a revision-control system or even a set of
backups.  Indeed, if he had had such backups, they could have saved him when
suffered a disk crash in 2003.

The current repository reconstructs as much of this history as possible
from two sources: crawls of the Wayback Machine on his website
(http://users.erols.com/whitaker/) and my own much less extensive copying
from that site while it was still active. From these I have hundreds of
views from 1999 to 2007, when he stopped work on the program.

A third source of website changes is a bit less obvious:  updates to HTML
files included in the .zip files posted to the site.  Oftentimes a
subsequent spider run captured those changes, but sometimes not:  a file
may have had a second update before the spider looked to it anew.  This is
sometimes evident in a scan of the history.

After using a script to detect the points at which each of the files was
introduced or changed, I characterized the website changes at each point in
order to write commit messages for a script to use when committing to the
Git repo.

What results is a reconstruction of the website and program history that is
probably as good as we can get.
It diverges from complete binary fidelity in these respects:

. HTML files have whitespace trimmed from the ends of lines and use Unix
line terminations (a single linefeed character).
Website updates often added or removed trailing whitespace; leaving that
unaltered would signficantly clutter the files' history.

. Large binary files (.zip and .exe files) are replaced by small text files
describing what they were.
The only exceptions are the word-list archives _dictpage.zip_ and
_listall.zip_; these are carried unchanged.
Users interested in finding the originals may look for them on archive.org.

. Program sources contained in _wordsall.zip_ and _tools.zip_ are copied
unchanged into their respective directories (_wordsall/_ and _tools/_) just
as if Col. Whitaker had committed them to revision control.

. The small counter-maintenance pages _count.htm_ and _counter.htm_, which
contain links to a CGI script, are omitted.

. Where pairs of files have the same contents but the names differ in case
(like listall.zip/LISTALL.ZIP), I retain only the all-lowercase version.

The Wayback Machine is selective in what it spiders; it concentrates on
text files, especially those which it judges to change often.  Also, there
is necessarily a delay between the time a change is posted to the site and
the time the spider sees it. Some files it fails to see at all; it other
cases it is slow to look for updates of binary files.
In a few cases I moved the update timestamp of a file in the Git history
when I had access to the file-modification timestamp (via .zip-file
directories or my own spidering of the site when it was still available.)

=== Version numbers

Col. Whitaker's version-number scheme presents a couple of difficulties for
anyone trying to track the version history and wanting to publish the
results for Linux distributions.
Changes were often made to the codebase without altering the version number.
Indeed, I have a pair of wordsall.zip files that are different but both
report a version number of 1.97.
The other issue is that a number of version-number schemes have no way to
deal with version-number suffixes like Ec, Ed, or FC.
Schemes having such difficulties include those of Gentoo Linux,
Debian GNU/Linux, and https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning].

I resolved this by adding a dot-number group to the minor version number.
This restores compatibility with the Gentoo and Debian schemes and satisfies
the minimal requirements of Semantic Versioning.
Despite the fact that Semantic Versioning would demand the increment of
the minor version number in several instances, in all cases I retain Col.
Whitaker's original minor version number.

=== Version history details

This is the program's version history I have been able to reconstruct by

|=======

The "Version" column shows the version number the program reports, the
"Tag Ver" column shows the identifier by which I refer to the version,
and "Have Sources?" shows the versions for which the sources are available
in this repo.

I see two trends in the way he assigns version numbers.  The first is to
mark big changes with some semantic marker in the version number while
smaller changes merely modify that marker; the second is to avoid
three-digit minor-version numbers.
Evidence: in 2004 he worked out an English-to-Latin mode, a major new
function that five years earlier he said he didn't think was possible to
implement.  He did not mark it as 1.98 but 1.97 with an ''E'' suffix.
Subsequent corrections resulted in changes to the ''E'': ''Ec'' and ''Ed''.
The ''F'' series seemed only to expand on ''E''.

Following the big-change hypothesis and given the fact that he asserts a
first copyright date of 1993, it seems likely that version 1.93 was indeed
the first released version of the program.

=== Notes about the available versions

All seven available versions of WORDS compile and run successfully when
built with the build scripts provided in this repo.

The build scripts apply patches to the original files so that the programs
work properly in all target environments.  The code which reads the
ADDONS.LAT and UNIQUES.LAT files at program-start time fails when the line
endings in the files is not of the expected type for the host OS.  The
build scripts therefore remove the carriage returns from these files when
the host OS uses bare linefeeds for line endings.  All the data files,
regardless of target OS, have ^Z characters stripped from them.  Other
patches are version-specific, as detailed below.

Earlier versions of the program have an important limitation:  they create
temporary files in the directory in which they run.  This makes the program
run incorrectly for users who have no write permissions in that directory.
Users wishing to test those versions are advised to install these versions
under their home directories.

==== Version 1.95.0 (reports as 1.95)
These sources were not on the Wayback Machine; I downloaded them in 2000 and
retained the files.  Unfortunately I did not keep the original ZIP file.

The sources of the earliest versions of words include three data files whose
names end in a dot: 'INFLECTS.', 'ADDONS.', and 'UNIQUES.'.  Starting with
version 1.96 these files are named 'INFLECTS.LAT', 'ADDONS.LAT', and
'UNIQUES.LAT'.  I suspect the change came about because of reports that NTFS
(the native filesystem of Windows NT) found such names to be problematic.

Even the current versions of Windows are affected by this NTFS problem
(other filesystems, such as EXT4 in Linux and HPFS in OS/2 are not).
For that reason, the build scripts for version 1.95.0 rename the files to have
the .LAT extension and patch `latin_file_names.ads` to use the new names.

*This version creates temporary files at run time in the library directory.
Avoid installing it in a system directory.*

==== Version 1.96.0 (reports as 1.96)
These sources came from the Wayback Machine but the ZIP file is incomplete.
Archive.org reports a file size of 1308056 bytes but closes the connection
after only 1048323 bytes are transferred.  (This transfer size is 253 bytes
shy of one megabyte, which suggests the file exceeded a size limit).
Fortunately, the truncation seems to have affected only one member of the
ZIP file, STEMLIST.GEN.  The directory entry for the file indicates a length
of 2176128 bytes, but only 356366 bytes were recoverable.
Since none of the Ada sources were lost, the program builds correctly.  The
shortened STEMLIST file results in an incomplete dictionary.

==== Version 1.97.1 (reports as 1.97)
This version extends the number of TACKONS (the term WW uses for enclitics:
morphemes such as 'que' and 'ne' that appear as suffixes) from 13 to 16.
He declared only 15 entries in the TACKONS array.  An attempt to allocate
a 16th element should raise an exception at run time, but some builds of
GNAT generate a WORDS executable that silently forgives the problem by
extending the array.  WW's compiler must have been doing this.
Other GNAT builds, such as the one in Debian, play by the book.  For their
sake, the Makefile patches `addons_package.ads` to fix the array
declaration.

== _Ad tempus futurum_

Further development of the WORDS system would be a very welcome thing, but
is unlikely in the current repo.  It stands mostly a witness to Col.
Whitaker's work as he left it.

It is gratifying that several people have undertaken to keep the work alive
by preserving the sources of the final version Col. Whitaker released.
Some have even gone on to further development of the program and data.
This aligns with Col. Whitaker's own intentions.  He stated that he thought
he would never finish the program.  He leaves it to future maintainers.

Martin Keegan has done
https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words[considerable refactoring of the
Ada source].
It forms the basis of the
https://salsa.debian.org/CalumMcConnel-guest/whitakers-words[Debian
_whitakers-words_ package].
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whitaker%27s_Words[Wikipedia
article on the _WORDS_ program] lists Keegan's work as a preservation
effort, but it might better be described as a resumption of development
since he

. Cleaned up the arrangement of source files and refactored some of them
(though I do have a quibble with reduplication of directory names in the
file names).

. Made the program know where to find its dictionary files, thus eliminating
the requirement that those files be in the current directory when running the
program.

. Corrected several program errors

. Corrected and augmented the dictionary files

. Added a test suite

. Stated a roadmap for improvements to the program, data, and interface

It is still a work in progress, though.  The Makefile has no _install_
target and the program still has a startup message that contains Col.
Whitaker's original contact information.  It also, misleadingly,
identifies itself as version 1.97FC.

The version 1.97FC in my repo is from Col. Whitaker's unmodified sources.
In that sense it would be good to think of "FC" as meaning "Final Cut".
Even for the purpose of building development versions, Keegan and his team
would do well to bump up the version number and adjust the startup message
to update the contact information and note their own contributions.

If I were to decide to take up the project myself, I would be inclined to
change its algorithm and tooling--but having hit too many pain points with
Ada, I would do it in Go.

In any event, it is good to recall the words of Cicero on this 104th
anniversary of the 1918 Armistice:  _cedant arma togae._
