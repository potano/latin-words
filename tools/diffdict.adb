procedure DIFFDICT is
  
begin
  null;  
  
  
 --  Two DICTLINEs, sorted the same way
--  Read into memory arrays (because we have so much memory)
--  Compared for STEMS, PART, FLAGs, (||), MEAN
--  The difference generated and written to output file
--  Color coded, if possible
  
--  Two DICTLINEs can then be compared and corrections made
--  A second run with the corrections gives a benchmark
--  Another exercise some time later produces another difference file
--  The two difference files are then DIFFed giving the changes made over time
