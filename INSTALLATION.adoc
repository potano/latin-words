The scripts included in this repository are designed for use in a POSIX 
environment to build and install the WORDS program and optional tools.  This
process works for all seven versions of WORDS contained in this repo.  These
build scripts work with

* Linux distros that have a GNU userland (viz. most Linux distros)
* BSD distros for which Ravenports is available
* Microsoft Windows using MSYS2 as a build environment

The build process uses the familiar 'configure' / 'make' / 'make install'
steps.  In order to run these, the user must first prepare the system for
the build process.  Setup instructions are given below for a number of
target systems.  Next, go to <<build_scenarios,Build scenarios>> to see the
supported installation scenarios.

An alternative approach is available for users of Gentoo Linux via Portage
and a local overlay.
Skip down to <<with_portage,Gentoo Linux using Portage>>.

== Setup needed for Linux systems

The build scripts require `gnatmake` (a helper executable supplied with
GNAT), a Bourne Shell (typically `bash`), and GNU `make` plus tools almost
always present in a Linux system: `cp`, `install`, `sed`, `tar`, `tr`, and
`rm`.  _Git_ is also required unless the user works exclusively with a
distribution tarball.  The sections below indicate which packages that each
distro family requires along with an example of a command line which would
install them.  The build scripts have been confirmed to work correctly with
all of the distros named in this section.

=== Arch Linux and derivatives (including Manjaro)

Package manager: pacman

* package for 'make': *make*
* package for 'gnatmake': *gcc-ada*
* package for 'git': *git*

 pacman -S make gcc-ada git

=== Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives (including Ubuntu and Linux Mint)

Package manager: dpkg (using the `apt` command)

* package for 'make': *make*
* package for 'gnatmake': *gnat*
* package for 'git': *git*

 apt install make gnat git

=== Fedora Linux and derivatives

Package manager: RPM (using the `dnf` command)

* package for 'make': *make*
* package for 'gnatmake': *gcc-gnat*
* package for 'git': *git*

 dnf install make gcc-gnat git

=== Gentoo Linux

Package manager: Portage (using the `emerge` command)

* 'make' is included in the base Gentoo installation
* package for 'gnatmake': *dev-lang/gnat-gpl*
* package for 'git': *dev-vcs/git*

 emerge gnat-gpl dev-vcs/git

The *gnat-gpl* ebuild is actually a *sys-devel/gcc* ebuild modified to
bootstrap an Ada compiler along with a C compiler.  The underlying GCC
version for *gnat-gpl* is not allowed to occupy the same package slot as an
already installed GCC version.  The Gentoo Ada project is working to move
GNAT fully into the standard *sys-devel/gcc* package.  When that happens,
the separate *dev-lang/gnat-gpl* will go away and GNAT will be available in
the same slot as the main GCC when the `ada` USE flag is set.

In the meantime, users have to deal with the fact that the active GCC
version generally does not offer GNAT.  The easiest workaround is to set
the slotted `gnatmake` directly into the PATH.  The directory has a
name like `/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/10.3.0` (substitute the actual
GCC version in place of `10.3.0` and the architecture as shown from the
`uname -m` command for `x86_64`).  Add this directory to the PATH in the
current shell to build WORDS.

=== Open SUSE and derivatives

Package manager: ZYpp (using the `zypper` command)

* package for 'make': *make*
* package for 'gnatmake': *gcc-ada*
* package for 'git': *git*

 zypper install make gcc-ada git

=== Slackware Linux

Slackware installs its entire package collection by default; the user
decides what _not_ to install.  Be sure these packages and their
dependencies are installed:

* *bash*
* *sed*
* *make*
* *gcc-gnat*
* *git*

== Setup needed for BSD systems (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Dragonfly BSD)

We have to obtain GNAT from a third party since GNAT is no longer available
among the standard BSD packages.  The Ravenports package manager includes
GNAT in its internal package-building toolchain, which Ravenports can
rebuild from source.  Ravenports is designed so that this toolchain is
available only for its own package-building processes, but accessing this
toolchain from the outside requires simply the setting of two environment
variables.  We do not use the Ravenports build framework or packaging
system.  Indeed, Ravenports includes a port for WORDS, but its `words` runs
incorrectly since it lacks the needed patches for ADDONS and UNIQUES.

A Ravenports installation must be tailored to the BSD disribution on which
it runs.  There are separate tarballs for each supported distribution as
well as distinct sets of installation instructions.  *Ravenports is not
available for OpenBSD or Darwin (MacOS)*.  It _may_ be possible to use one
of the other Ravenports tarballs to build WORDS on OpenBSD or Darwin. I did
not attempt this.

Proceed through the next three sections to prepare the setup to build WORDS.

==== Install tools from the distro's package manager

The build scripts will not work with BSD 'make'; the require GNU 'make'.
The BSD distros call this package 'gmake'; this is also the name of the
executable.  Download 'git' if needed.  Note that the default DragonFly
installation already includes 'git-lite'.

Command needed to install these depends on the distro:

. FreeBSD: `pkg install gmake git`
. NetBSD: `pkgin install gmake git`
. DragonFly BSD: `pkg install gmake`

==== Install Ravenports

To install Ravenports, go to https://www.ravenports.com and follow the
instructions in the Quick Start page for your BSD distribution.  For the
purposes of building WORDS, it is necessary to follow those instructions
only up to the "Install Ravenports metaport" section.

Hint: if the Ravenports installation fails at some point (as it did for me
when `ravensw` segfaulted in the setup for DragonFly BSD), you might try
installing an older version for the _same_ distro.

==== Environment-variable setup

Now log in as a regular user and enter a Bourne Shell.  (The `configure`
script won't work with csh or tcsh.)  A few adjustments to the build
environment are needed in order to build WORDS.

All the Makefile targets except `make clean` require 'gmake'.  The default
target (which builds WORDS) requires a setup of the PATH and LD_LIBARY_PATH
environment variables:

. PATH must include the Ravenports-toolchain `bin/` directories.
. LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set to refer to the Ravenports-toolchain `lib/`
directories.

Since the exact paths vary according to the BSD flavor and the Ravenports
version, we do not indicate their exact settings here.  Use this command to
display what must be added to the PATH variable:

 find /raven/share/raven/toolchain -name bin -type d | xargs echo | tr ' ' :

Likewise this command prints what must be set into LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

 find /raven/share/raven/toolchain -name lib -type d | xargs echo | tr ' ' :

It is helpful to set up a 'make' script in a local directory along these
lines:

----
#!/bin/sh
export PATH="<ravenpath bin directories>:$PATH"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<ravenpath lib directories>" gmake $@
----

Be sure to mark the file as executable, for example:

 chmod +x bin/make

Call this script when the instructions direct you to use the default `make`
target to build the package.  You may use `gmake` for other targets,
particularly the `install` target.  Example:

----
.configure
~/bin/make
# Then, as root
cd ~user/latin-words
gmake install
----

Extra points for setting `$HOME/bin` early in the PATH.  Remember to use
`gmake` when installing as _root_
.

== Setup needed for Microsoft Windows

There are several ways to set up the needed build environment;
assuming the common case for desktops and laptops (Windows 10 or later on an
AMD64/Intel64 processor), this way appears to be the best.

Download and install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org.  Close any
command-prompt window the installer may have opened and open the
correct one for our purpose:  click on the newly installed shortcut
labelled MSYS2 UCRT64.  Now we may install the needed dependencies:

* mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-make
* mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc-ada
* git

Run these commands to install the dependencies:

----
pacman -Fy
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-make mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc-ada git
----

Finish the setup with these commands to work around a couple of glitches:

----
cd /ucrt64/bin; ln -s mingw32-make.exe make.exe; cd -
git config --global core.ignorecase true
----

[NOTE]
====
This note explains why we recommend the above setup.  Those not interested
may skip ahead. 

The build scripts in this repo almost certainly would not work with
Microsoft's native build systems. To use this repo we need an environment
that provides GNU _make_.  I went with MSYS2 since not only does it let
Makefiles be unconcerned about whether executable files have an _.exe_
extension but also that it generates executables that can run on other
Windows machines without having to install special libraries.

MSYS2 is a bit confusing to use since it includes multiple distinct
toolchains, each based on its own combination of base Windows C library
('msvcrt', 'ucrt', or 'cygwin'), compilers, and tools.  The MSYS2
documentation refers to these toolchains as _environments_, each with its
own path prefix.  MSYS2 provides a start-menu icon for each environment.

Just as with any Linux distro, MSYS2 offers packages the user may install.
Many of packages in the MSYS2 ecosystem have environment-specific variants,
though other packages are environment-agnostic.  This is what gives rise to
the cumbersome package names.  It is up to the user to install the correct
flavor of any given package.

The AMD64 GNAT system is available in only two MSYS2 environments, MINGW64
and UCRT64.  The latter uses the 'ucrt' Windows library, which is the one
that Microsoft promotes for current and future versions of Windows.  The
above instructions reflect that choice.

To use MINGW64 instead of UCRT64, install these libraries in a MING64 window.

* mingw-w64-x86_64-make
* mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-ada
* git

The glitch-fix commands become

 cd /mingw64/bin; ln -s mingw32-make.exe make.exe; cd -
 git config --global core.ignorecase true

Similar adjustments are necessary for Windows on ARM processors.
====

[[build_scenarios]]
== Build scenarios

Now that the system is prepared for the build process, be logged in as a
normal user and do one of the following:

* Clone the https://github.com/potano/latin-words repo with Git and `cd` to
the `latin-words` directory.  Check out an older version of WORDS if
desired.
* Download and untar a distribution tarball and `cd` into the directory just
created.

Examples of these:

----
# To clone the Git repo
git clone https://github.com/potano/latin-words
cd latin-words
----

----
# To untar a distribution tarball
tar xzf latin-words-1.97.12.tar.gz
cd latin-words-1.97.12
----

Now run `configure` and `make` as needed.  The sections below detail some
typical use cases.  Remember to use any variant of the `make` command that
distro-specific instructions may have directed you to use.

[NOTE]
====
The WORDS program is designed to load its dictionary files from the current
directory when the program starts.  That means that either a GUI icon or
a small script should be set up to switch to that directory and then start
`words`.  Traditionally, `words` and any other executable such as `meanings`
is installed in the same directory as the dictionary files; we follow that
pattern here.

Typically, these build scripts install these to
`/usr/local/lib/latin-words/` and the startup script as
`/usr/local/bin/words`.  The setup scenarios may alter this.
====

=== Basic install

The basic steps build the `words` binary and its dictionary files, install
them in the `/usr/local/lib/latin-words/` directory, and installs the script
`/usr/local/bin/words` in the PATH.

----
./configure
make
----

Then as _root_ `cd` into the build directory and run this:

----
make install
----

=== Building `meanings` along with `words`

Most versions of the WORDS sources include the source file for the
`meanings` executable.  Intended as an aid to be provided to test-takers, it
displays the meanings of words but not an analysis of their inflections.
Adding the `--enable-meanings` switch to the `./configure` command builds
`meanings` alongside `words` and likewise installs a script in the PATH to
run the main `meanings` program.

----
./configure --enable-meanings
# ...
----

=== Building the optional tools

In May, 2005 (in time for the 1.97Ed release, v1.97.7), Col. Whitaker
published the sources for tools he used to construct the dictionaries.  He
revised these in January, 2007.  Adding the `--enable-tools` switch to the
`./configure` command line builds these tools plus the few tools that have
always been present in the main 'wordsall.zip' used to process the
dictionary files at build time.  (For versions earlier than v1.97.7, this
option installs only those make-dictionary programs.)  These tools are
installed in the same directory as the other executables.  No startup
scripts are installed for these.

----
./configure --enable-tools
# ...
----

=== Building with a different prefix

The `--prefix=` switch of the `./configure` command alters the base location
of the dictionary/binary directory and the script directory, which by
default is `/usr/local`.  MSYS2 and Gentoo Portage set this automatically to
directories more apt for their purposes.

An important application of this is building and installing WORDS directly
in the user's own HOME directory tree.  For example, this installs the WORDS
data in `~/lib/latin-words` and the startup script in `~/bin`.  This time it
is the user, not _root_, who runs `make install`.

----
./configure --prefix=$HOME
make
make install
----

=== Changing the startup-script name

Normally the startup script is installed under the name `words` in a
directory configured to be in the PATH.  The `WORDS_CMD_NAME=` argument of
`./configure` sets the command name.

For example, this sets the command to run WORDS to be `whitakers-words`:

----
./configure WORDS_CMD_NAME=whitakers-words
# ...
----

Likewise the `MEANINGS_CMD_NAME=` argument sets the name of the startup
script for `meanings`.  You still need to use the `--enable-meanings` switch
to build the meanings executable.

=== Split installation

All of the above build scenarios involve modifying the arguments of the
`configure` script.  In all these cases, a `make uninstall` would remove all
of the installed files because their locations would be baked into the
Makefile.

By applying arguments to the `make` command we can install WORDS in
non-standard ways.

The `MAINDIR=` argument of the `make` command overrides the default
_prefix_`/lib/latin-words` location.  If applied both to the default `make`
command and the `make install`, the result is a startup script installed
in a directory determined by the prefix and a main directory not
determined by the prefix.

In this example, we install the `words` startup script in `~/bin` and the
main directory at `~/misc/latin-words`.

----
./configure --prefix=$HOME
make MAINDIR="$HOME/misc/latin-words"
main MAINDIR="$HOME/misc/latin-words" install
----

=== Words version zoo

We can combine the above techniques to set up a "zoo" of WORDS versions.
This makes it so that the user may issue a command like `words_v1.95.0` to
start the version under a name determined by the Git tag.  Assuming that `~/bin` is in the
user's path, we can use this block of commands:

----
git tag | while read tag; do
  git checkout $tag
  ./configure --prefix="$HOME" WORDS_CMD_NAME="words_$tag"
  make MAINDIR="$HOME/zoo/$tag"
  make MAINDIR="$HOME/zoo/$tag" install
  make clean
done
----

This builds all the WORDS versions in the repo, sets each up in a separate
directory under `~/zoo/`, and makes a startup script in the user's `bin`
directory with a separate startup script for each version.

=== WORDS without a startup script

It is possible to install only the main directory without a startup script.
The main use case for this is to prepare a WORDS installation for access
via a GUI.

The `install-main` target installs just the main directory
containing the `words` executable, the dictionaries, and, if selected, the
tools and/or `meanings`.  The target also accepts the `MAINDIR=`
command-line argument.

This example installs the `words` executable and dictionaries, along with
program icon that Col. Whitaker included in the Windows-binary .zip files,
into the directory `~/staging`.

----
./configure
make
make MAINDIR="$HOME/staging" install-main
cp assets/SPQR.ICO ~/staging
----

=== Preparing binary packages

None of the `make` targets install documentation.  The build process gathers
the principal documentation that Col. Whitaker wrote into the `docs/`
subdirectory.  Packagers may want to copy the documentation from there.

The `assets/` subdirectory contains `SPQR.ICO`, the icon file that Col.
Whitaker included in Windows binary-package .zip files.

Of interest to Linux and BSD distro maintainers:  the Makefile respects the
`DESTDIR` _make_-command argument, the standard
mechanism in the _autotools_ world to specify an offset path to a staging
directory.

For packaging WORDS for Windows it would be more helpful to use the
`MAINDIR=` argument as described above.

Issues like the preparation of a Windows package installer are left as an
exercise for the reader.

=== Preparing source-distribution tarballs

The `make dist` target generates a distribution tarball for the checked-out
version and leaves it in the `distrib/` subdirectory.  Likewise, the
`make ebuild` target generates the corresponding Gentoo ebuild in the same
directory.

Both the tarball and the ebuild reflect the version number.


== Reference: options for `configure` and `make`

=== `configure` command

The 'configure' command may be run with any combination of these arguments:

--prefix=`directory`:: set pathname prefix for target 'bin/' and 'lib/'
directories (default: '/usr/local/')

--libdir=`directory`:: set pathname of the directory for executable library
files (default: [prefix]'/lib/').  Normally the main files (dictionaries
and main executables) are installed in the `latin-words` directory within
this library directory.

--execdir=`directory`:: name of the directory for executable files available
from the command line (default: [prefix]`/bin/`).  The startup-script files
are installed here.

--enable-meanings:: build and install the 'meanings' executable

--enable-tools:: build and install dictonary-file-management tools

WORDS_CMD_NAME='name':: set name of command to run the main WORDS program
(default: 'words')

MEANINGS_CMD_NAME='name':: set name of command to run the meanings-only
program (default: 'meanings')


=== 'make' command

The `make` command line has the form `make` [options] [<target>]

The make target must be one or more of the following.

`all` (or no target given):: Build the main program(s) (`words` always
and `meanings` if configured), helper programs, architecture-specific
data files (using the helper programs), additional tools (if configured),
and the startup scripts.  Also collects the HTML and text documents into
the `docs/` directory within the project.

`install`:: Install the executables and data files to the configured
directories.  The actions of this target are available separately as the
`install-main` and `install-exec` for use cases where only one of these is
needed.  See below for details.

`install-main`:: Install the main binary executables and data files to the
main directory (either the `latin-words` directory relative to the
configured --libdir or the directory selected by the MAINDIR= `make`
option.

`install-exec`:: Install the startup script(s) into the directory configured
by the --prefix or --bindir `configure` option or the `bindir=` make option.

`uninstall`:: Uninstall the files from the configured main directory and the
startup scripts from the configured binary directory.

`clean`:: Delete all generated files and directories within the project
directory.

`dist`:: Generate a distribution tarball for the currently checked-out
version.  Writes the tarball in the `distrib/` directory within the project
directory.

`ebuild`:: Generate a Gentoo Portage ebuild for the currently checked-out
version.  Writes the file in the `distrib/` directory within the project.

In addition to the normal `make` option arguments, the following are
supported for building WORDS.

GNATMAKE=_name_:: Specify the name of the `gnatmake` executable

GMFLAGS=_flags_:: Specify the GNAT compiler options for building tools and
the dictionary-building helpers (default: `-gnat95`)

libdir=_path_:: Specify the library directory (default: [prefix]`/lib`)

MAINDIR=_path_:: Specify the directory to hold the dictionary files and main
executables  (default: [libdir]`/latin-words`)

MAINPROG_GMFLAGS=_flags_:: Specify the GNAT compiler options for building
the main program(s) (default: `-O3 $(GMFLAGS)`)


[[with_portage]]
== Gentoo Linux using Portage

Gentoo Linux users intent on installing WORDS on their systems are advised
to use Portage for the purpose.  This makes it so that the program is known
to the package manager just like any other normally installed package.
Intrepid users of other distros _could_ choose to use Portage also via
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix[Gentoo Prefix], but for most
non-Gentoo users, it would be easier to use the main instructions given
above for `configure` and `make`.

=== Setting up the package in a local overlay

It would be safe to assume that you are reading this section because the
package is not available in the Portage tree or a published overlay.  If
you have not yet set up an overlay, follow the instructions in the
Gentoo-wiki page https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Creating_an_ebuild_repository[
Creating an ebuild repository] to set one up.

When the overlay is ready, follow these steps:

. Create the directory `app-dicts/latin-words` at the root directory of the
overlay, `cd` to that directory, and copy the ebuild there.
. If you have the distribution tarball, copy it to the distribution-file
directory.  The `DISTDIR` variable of `make.conf` sets this location, which
is typically `/var/cache/distfiles`.  If you do not have tarball on hand,
the `ebuild` command in the next step will fetch the file for you.
. Run the command `ebuild latin-words-1.97.12 manifest` where the second
argument is the name of the file containing the ebuild.  Tab completion can
help you here..
. Add an entry for `app-dicts/latin-words` to the `package.accept_keywords`
file either in `/etc/portage/` or the profile directory of the overlay.

=== USE flags

These USE flags are available:

`meanings`:: build the `meanings` executable and make it accessible via the
`meanings` command
`tools`:: build the optional WORDS dictionary tools and install them in the
WORDS main directory (`/usr/lib64/latin-words`).

Note that the ebuild takes advantage of the `ada` eclass and thereby avoids
the need for you to enable the correct GCC slot for GNAT.  See the
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Ada[Gentoo Ada Project] page for more
details.

At this point you should be able to do the normal emerge operations on
the package such as

----
emerge -va latin-words
----
