<H1>WORDS - Version 1.97 for OS/2 (i386) <BR>
LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>
<P>


<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS Latin-to-English
dictionary program for the PC running OS/2.  </H3>
<P>
Ported to OS/2 by Fr.  Mike Thompson (mbt@gator.net) The latest version,
1.97, was released on August 30, 2001.  W.W.  slipped in a bug fix on
January 1, 2002 which did not result in a change in the version number.

<H3>
Downloading </H3>
<P>
A .zip file for the program and data is located at the
<A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-viewer?sh=1&fname=/pub/os2/apps/misc/words-1.97-os2.zip">
Hobbes OS/2 archive
</A>.  Go there and download the file words-1.97-os2.zip.
<P>
All you need to do to install the package is make a directory for it,
extract the distribution ZIP file into the directory, and make a desktop
program object that executes WORDS.EXE.  (Anssi Blomqvist's Program
Creator works fine for this.) Just be sure to set the program object's
startup directory to the directory you're using.
<P>
At the minimum, the following files must all live in the same directory:

<PRE>
  WORDS.EXE
  ADDONS.LAT
  DICTFILE.GEN
  INDXFILE.GEN
  INFLECTS.SEC
  STEMFILE.GEN
  UNIQUES.LAT
</PRE>
<P>
Since Words uses the standard I/O streams rather than the OS/2 VIO API,
you can redirect the input and/or output as you wish.  The only
restriction is that the current directory must contain all the supporting
files.

<H3>Output</H3>
<P>
Words is a text-mode dictionary program which translates and analyzes
Latin words entered from the keyboard or a text file.
<P>
For each word entered, the program identifies all the possible
interpretations of the word, then, for each interpretation, makes an
analysis of the word (part of speech, declension, conjugation, case,
tense, voice, etc.) and gives the usual meaning of the root form.  As an
example, given the word &quot;amas,&quot; Words produces the following output:

<PRE>
am.as                N      1 1 ACC P F
ama, amae  N  F    lesser
bucket; water bucket; (esp. fireman's bucket);

am.as                V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 2 S
amo, amare, amavi, amatus  V
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;

This shows that "amas" can be interpreted in two different ways:
  1. as a noun (ama=bucket; first declension; feminine accusative plural; stem
    "am", ending "as"; principal parts ama, amae), or
  2. as a verb (amare=to love; first conjugation; second-person singular
    present active indicative; stem "am", ending "as"; principal parts
    amo, amare, amavi, amatus).
</PRE>


<H3>The Port</H3>
<P>
This port of the program to OS/2 involved *no* programming effort.  Don't
look for OS/2 patches to the source code: there aren't any.  It all worked
the first try.  The only &quot;hard&quot; thing I did was write the file you are
reading.
<P>
I used EMX 0.9d fix-level 4, GCC 2.8.1, and Gnat 3.13p to compile Words.
This Gnat version is available from
<A HREF="ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat/3.13p/contrib/os2/">NYU ftp</A>.  The write-up for the
roll-your-own compilation of Words is at
<A HREF="http://users.erols.com/whitaker/wordsdev.htm">WORDSDEV</A> and includes the source
archive.  It's all frightfully easy.
