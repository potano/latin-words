<H1>WORDS - Version 1.94 - DOS
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides a downloadable Latin-to-English dictionary program
for a DOS PC.
<BR>Instructions below.</H3>

<H4>14 March 1999 - Version 1.94</H4>

<P>The DOS version is getting too large and may be subject to STORAGE_ERROR
in some user configurations
(especially when running with an '@' input file) if there is
much less than 600,000 bytes of memory free.  Try to clear as much available
ROM as possible if you have problems of this nature.

<P>The DOS code has been reduced by 30KB, from other versions, by modifying the
parameter input and the help.  The technical capability is unaffected.
A further reduction is size could be accomplished by removing capabilities
like compound verbs, examples, and information on possible stems on
unknowns.

<P>As an experiment a version, WORDSMIN, has been included
that was compiled for i86 REAL MODE.   It takes the same dictionary files.
This should run on old 8086, 8088, 80186 and 80286 machines.
This version has also been reduced by eliminating the DO_COMPOUNDS
and DO_STEMS_FOR_UNKNOWNS, so it will run in regular DOS situations
if the normal version has too many STORAGE_ERRORs.

<P>As a safety precaution, the previous version is continued on the site.

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
There is a <A HREF="word194d.exe"><B>WORD194D.EXE</B></A>,
a self-extracting DOS EXE file
that the viewer can download as a binary file if his browser allows.

It runs is line-oriented, without fancy screens or graphics.
The DOS version will also run in Windows 95, but the Windows version
has the advantage that it terminates gracefully
when run in the DOS partition of Windows 95, while the DOS version
exits with complaints.


<P>
It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things together)
and copy the WORD194D.EXE into it, then run it in that subdirectory.
The .EXE file, executed on your machine will produce about 5 MB
of program and data files (and then may be discarded).

<P>The files created are:
<PRE>WORDS.EXE
INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.
UNIQUES.
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
WORD.HLP
WORDSDOC.HTM
WORDSDOC.TXT
WORDSDOS.HTM
WORDSMIN.EXE
</PRE>

<P>The main program created is WORDS.EXE.  Run that
to do Latin-to-English word translations.  With <I>amo</I> as input,
the output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>The file WORDSDOC.TXT provides some documentation, and there is included
an HTML version which is also accessable on this site as
<A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<P>WORDS for DOS executes on a IBM-compatible PC, 386 or better, running DOS.
WORDS is disk oriented, so a fast disk, a RAMDISK, or caching helps.
It requires as much memory as possible, or it will raise (somewhat
recoverable) STORAGE_ERROR.

<P>The present version is 1.94 and replaces a previous version 1.93
from August 1998.  There are some internal differences from
the previous version, but the user difference is mostly in a somewhat
improved dictionary and forms.


<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS, with self-extractor:
<BR><BR><A HREF="mean194d.exe"><B>MEAN194D.EXE</B></A> for DOS
<BR><BR>This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no
parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.

Feedback is invited.  If there is a problem in installing or operating,
in the results or their display, or if your favorite word is omitted
from the dictionary, let me know.
