<H1>WORDS - Version 1.95 - DOS
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides a downloadable Latin-to-English dictionary program
for a DOS PC.  For regular users, the files to download are:
<BR><BR><A HREF="word195d.exe"><B>WORD195D.EXE</B></A>

<H4>19 October 1999 - Version 1.95</H4>

<P>The DOS WORDS code has been reduced by modifying the
parameter input and the help.  The technical capability is unaffected.
It does carry two extra help files, rather than having the help coded in.

<P>A further reduced version has been generated.
It takes the same dictionary files.  This version has
also been reduced by eliminating the DO_COMPOUNDS, DO_EXAMPLES
and DO_STEMS_FOR_UNKNOWNS, so it will run in regular DOS situations
if the normal version has too many STORAGE_ERRORs.  This version is
recommended for most users and is now the default version of WORDS.

<P>The version with the DO_COMPOUNDS and DO_EXAMPLES capabilities,
but with the HELP on files, has been renamed WORDSMAX.  This may
give STORAGE_ERROR problems when operating in systems without
enough DOS (first 640KB) free memory.


<P>MEANINGS, giving only the dictionary form and meaning, is also
minimized.

<P>There is a WORDSDOC.TXT ASCII text file of the documentation
in WORDSDOC.HTM, since it is expected that those running on DOS
systems might not have an intenet browser installed, but can have
the program copied off the net on a friend's machine.

<P>For this situation, the system for DOS has been broken into two files
so that they may fit on floppy disks,  The full system having grown
too large for a single floppy.


<P>As a safety precaution, the previous version is continued on the site.

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
There is a <A HREF="word195d.exe"><B>WORD195D.EXE</B></A>,
a self-extracting DOS EXE file
that the viewer can download as a binary file if his browser allows.

It runs is line-oriented, without fancy screens or graphics.
The DOS version will also run in Windows 95, but the Windows version
has the advantage that it terminates gracefully
when run in the DOS partition of Windows 95, while the DOS version
exits with complaints.


<P>
It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things together)
and copy the WORD195D.EXE into it, then run it in that subdirectory.
The .EXE file, executed on your machine will produce about 6 MB
of program and data files (and then may be discarded).

<P>The files created are sufficient to run the system:
<PRE>WORDS.EXE    --  The recommended (minimized) program
INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.
UNIQUES.
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
WORDHMOD.HLP
WORDHMDV.HLP
WORDSDOS.TXT
</PRE>
<P>Another selfextracting file
<BR><BR><A HREF="more195d.exe"><B>MORE195D.EXE</B></A> for DOS contains:
<PRE>WORDSMAX.EXE       --  The full program, not minimized
MEANINGS.EXE    --  Delivering only meanings, hardcoded
WORDSDOC.TXT    --  An ASCII DOS text file with the documentation
TEST500.        --  A test file of 500 lines of Latin text
</PRE>

<P>The main program created is WORDS.EXE (recommended - also WORDSMAX
and MEANINGS as explained above).  Run that
to do Latin-to-English word translations.  With <I>amo</I> as input,
the output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>The file WORDSDOC.TXT provides some documentation, and there is
an HTML version which is also accessable on the WORDS net site as
<A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<P>WORDS for DOS executes on a IBM-compatible PC, 386 or better, running DOS.
WORDS is disk oriented, so a fast disk, a RAMDISK, or caching helps.
It requires as much memory as possible, or it will raise (somewhat
recoverable) STORAGE_ERROR.  WORDSMIN is recommended to reduce this problem.

<P>The present version is 1.95 and replaces a previous version 1.94
from March 1999.  There are some internal differences from
the previous version, but the user difference is mostly in a
improved dictionary.


<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS, as found in the MORE195D.EXE selfextractor.
<BR><BR>This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no
parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.

Feedback is invited.  If there is a problem in installing or operating,
in the results or their display, or if your favorite word is omitted
from the dictionary, let me know.
