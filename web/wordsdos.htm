a DOS PC.  For regular users, the files to download are: <BR>

<H4>15 September 2001- Version 1.97</H4>
<P>
The DOS WORDS code has been reduced slightly from the Windows version in
order that it might operate within the 640KB DOS limitation without
extensions.  There is, as before, modification of the parameter input and
the help.  This has no affect on operation or capability.  It does carry
an extra help file, rather than having the help coded in.
<P>
It is, however, a reduction in facilities by eliminating the DO_COMPOUNDS,
DO_EXAMPLES, DO_STEMS_FOR_UNKNOWNS, and some TRICKS so it will run in
regular DOS situations.  The full version will generate too many
STORAGE_ERRORs.  However it contains the full dictionary and word
construction.  The change from the previous (also reduced) version is that
TRICKS have been eliminated.  This is not as much of a problem as it once
might have been.  The dictionary is getting to be quite extensive and
should take care of all but the most demanding user.  There is some
possibility that offloading to preprocessing might allow recovery of some
deleted facilities in a future version.  This reduction allows the program
to run in DOS systems having about 600KB of more FREE MEMORY.  Check your
system by running CHKDSK.  Memory may be occupied by still resident
programs (initiated at startup, probably in AUTOEXEC.ABT) you are not
using at the time.  Eliminate any that you can, if sufficient memory is
not free.
<P>
If free memory in insufficient to run without excessive STORAGE_ERROR, a
MINWORDS version, further crippled by eliminating dictionary forms and the
output cleanup that was the major algorithmic change in 1.97.  The full
dictionary is still active.
<P>
There are two files to be downloaded that the viewer can download as
binary files if his browser allows.  The program and the data are in two
self-extracting files.  <BR>

<P>
The purpose of having two files is is that individually they are less than
the capacity of a 3 1/2&quot; floppy, so that you can copy them and pass them
on to a friend who might not have net capability.
<P>
 These .EXE files, executed on your machine will produce about 12 MB of
program and data files (and then may be discarded).
<P>
 It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things
together) and copy the .EXE into it, then run them in that subdirectory.
<P>
The files created are:

<PRE>
WORDS.EXE
MEANINGS.EXE
MINWORDS.EXE

WORDSDOS.TXT
WORDSDOC.TXT

INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
</PRE>
The main program created is WORDS.EXE.  Run thats to do Latin-to-English
word translations.  The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo

am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to

</TT></PRE>

<P>
There is a WORDSDOC.TXT ASCII text file of the net HTML documentation in <A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>
WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>, since it is expected that those running on DOS systems
might not have an intenet browser installed, but can have the program
copied off the net on a friend's machine.  This is stand-alone, it is not
callable from the WORDS program.
<P>
MEANINGS.EXE, giving only the dictionary form and meaning, is also
minimized.
<P>
WORDS for DOS executes on a IBM-compatible PC, 386 or better, running DOS.
WORDS is disk oriented, so a fast disk, a RAMDISK, or caching helps.  It
requires as much memory as possible, or it will raise (somewhat
recoverable) STORAGE_ERROR.
<P>
The present version is 1.97 and replaces a previous version.  The main
user difference is mostly in an improved dictionary and somewhat cleaner
TRIMmed output.

<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>
<P>
There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate for the
student to have access to the parsed forms information, but for which the
professor might allow simple meanings.  For this situation a modification
has been made producing a program called MEANINGS, as found in the
MORE195D.EXE selfextractor.  <BR>
<BR>
This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no parsing of
the word.  It is hard-coded so there is no way to output the case/tense,
as opposed to the option in WORDS that allows the temporary suppression of
this information.  It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which
seems to be appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone
requires a version that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Feedback is invited.  If there is a problem in installing or operating, in
the results or their display, or if your favorite word is omitted from the
dictionary, let me know.
