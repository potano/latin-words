<H1>WORDS - Version 1.97 for the Mac OS X
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the Mac running OS X. </H3>

<P>WORDS is a text/console program and has previously not been available
for the Mac.  The UNIX-based Mac OS X allows an easy port of the Ada code.

<H3>Downloading </H3>

<P>A .sit file for the program and data is located at
<B><A HREF="http://home.swbell.net/tfrusa/words-1.97.sit">

<P>At the minimum, the following files must all live in the same
folder/directory:
<PRE>
  words
  DICTFILE.GEN
  STEMFILE.GEN
  INDXFILE.GEN
  INFLECTS.SEC
  ADDONS.LAT
  UNIQUES.LAT

<H3>Execution</H3>

<P>The default configuration of the shell requires the user include a <B>./</B>
(period slash) in front of the executable name. It's important that the user
execute Words with the command "<B>./words</B>" - most Mac users use Terminal
very rarely (or never) and may be unfamiliar with its conventions.

<HR>
<H3>Output</H3>

<P>Words is a text-mode dictionary program which translates and analyzes Latin
words entered from the keyboard or a text file.

<P>For each word entered, the program identifies all the possible
interpretations of the word, then,
for each interpretation, makes an analysis of the word
(part of speech, declension, conjugation, case, tense, voice, etc.) and gives
the usual meaning of the root form.  As an example, given the word "amas,"
Words produces the following output:

<PRE>
am.as                N      1 1 ACC P F
ama, amae  N  F    lesser
bucket; water bucket; (esp. fireman's bucket);
am.as                V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 2 S
amo, amare, amavi, amatus  V
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;


This shows that "amas" can be interpreted in two different ways:
  1. as a noun (ama=bucket; first declension; feminine accusative plural; stem
    "am", ending "as"; principal parts ama, amae), or
  2. as a verb (amare=to love; first conjugation; second-person singular
    present active indicative; stem "am", ending "as"; principal parts
    amo, amare, amavi, amatus).
