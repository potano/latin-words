As an example, given the word"amas," Words produces the following output:   </p><pre> <br>am.as                N      1 1 ACC P F <br>ama, amae  N  F    <br>lesser bucket; water bucket; (esp. fireman's bucket); <br><br>am.as                V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 2 S <br>amo, amare, amavi, amatus  V <br>love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;   <br><br>This shows that "amas" can be interpreted in two different ways:   <br>1. as a noun (ama=bucket; first declension; feminine accusative plural; <br>stem     "am", ending "as"; principal parts ama, amae), <br><br>or<br>   <br>2. as a verb (amare=to love; first conjugation; second-person singular     <br>present active indicative; stem "am", ending "as"; <br>principal parts     amo, amare, amavi, amatus).  <br></pre>      <br>  <a href="http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm"> <b>Return to WORDShome<b></b></b></a>  <br></body></html>
