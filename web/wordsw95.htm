<H1>WORDS - Version 1.97 for Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the PC running Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP. </H3>

<P>
There is a quirk to viewing console/DOS-like programs on newer versions of Windows.
While this is not necessary to run WORDS, there are those who are more comfortable this way.
Remember to go to (change subdirectory to) the subdirectory in which
you have mounted the WORDS files.

<P>Windows ME has changed the
path to the MSDOS prompt to
<BR><FONT COLOR="FF0000"><B>Start>Programs>Accessories>MSDOS</B>
<FONT COLOR="000000">
<BR>Go there and run WORDS and apparently everything works like DOS as before.
<BR>For Windows 2000 the path to the prompt is
<BR><FONT COLOR="FF0000"><B>Start>Programs>Accessories>Command Prompt </B>
<FONT COLOR="000000">
<BR>For Windows XP the path to the prompt is
<BR><FONT COLOR="FF0000"><B>Start>All Programs>Accessories>Command Prompt </B>

<P>30 August 2001 - New version 1.97 of the Windows WORDS
has been mounted as the regular distribution.

<P>The only significant change is in
the presentation of the output.  There is now a lot of (default) TRIMming.
This is to make the program more friendly to student users.  Uncommon/untimely
parses are suppressed when there is a much more common/likely solution.
Vocatives and locatives are often suppressed.  Where such TRIMming
has occurred, an asterix (*) follows the output.  The user can cut
out the TRIM by setting a # parameter, and this has been made easier
by placing that parameter first in the # menu.

<P>In addition, there may be warnings on individual parses or
dictionary forms that are uncommon or of non-classical age.
This is not to say that the result is not the correct one,
but that the user may consider that information in light of what
he expects from the text being translated.  This is a preliminary
facility, as not all of the dictionary is properly coded yet,
but most is.

<P>The # parameter DO_STEMS_FOR_UNKNOWNS now puts out a page of
dictionary entries around the unknown words.  This seems to be much more
useful, in principle, than the previous attempt to construct a
sperious stem/inflection combination.  Try it.


<P>The dictionary now contains more than 30000 entries.
While certainly not complete,
WORDS is achieving a very high hit rate for some classical texts.
Caesar is apparently complete (except, as always, proper names).
The Vulgate Bible is without UNKNOWN (which is not to say that every
parse is as St. Jerome would have it).  The orderly update is continuing
slowly.  The user is requested to
forward important words that are missing and should be in,
and any that are parsed but seem to have the wrong meaning.

<P>
<HR>
<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>

<P>This is a version
compiled on Windows 95 to run as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy Windows GUI.
The DOS version will also run in Windows 95, but the Windows version
has the advantage that it terminates gracefully
when run in the DOS partition of Windows 95.

<P>
There are two files to be downloaded that the viewer can download
as binary files if his browser allows.
The program and the data are in two self-extracting files.
<BR><A HREF="disk1197.exe"><B>DISK1197.EXE</B></A>
<BR><A HREF="disk2197.exe"><B>DISK2197.EXE</B></A>

<P>The purpose of having two files is
is that individually they are less than the capacity of a 3 1/2" floppy,
so that you can copy them and pass them on to a friend who might not
have net capability.

<P>
These .EXE files, executed on your machine will produce about 12 MB
of program and data files (and then may be discarded).
<P>
It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things together)
and copy the .EXE into it, then run it in that subdirectory.

<P>The files created are:
<PRE>WORDS.EXE
MEANINGS.EXE

WORDS.HTM
WORDSW95.HTM
WORDSDOC.HTM

INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
WORDSDOC.HTM
WORDSW95.HTM
</PRE>

The main program created is WORDS.EXE.  Run that
to do Latin-to-English word translations.  The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S
amo, amare, amavi, amatus   V
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>The file WORDSDOC.HTM provides some documentation, and
is also accessible on this site as
<A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<P>WORDS for Windows 95 runs on a IBM-compatible PC, running Windows 95
(and Windows 98 and NT).




<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS, and it is available in the distribution.  Run this in the presence
of the dictionary files, just like WORDS.
This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no
parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that suppresses the dictionary form, let me know.
