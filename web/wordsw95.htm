<H1>WORDS - Version 1.94 for Windows 95
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the PC running Windows 95/98/NT. </H3>


<HR>
<P>21 June 1999 - A very slight modification of the Windows WORDS
(nominally called Version 1.94a) has been mounted as the regular
distribution.  This differs from the previous 1.94 only in a couple
of deep data record definitions (which are invisible to the use), and
in that the 3-way option has been reactivated.  It is unlikely that
anyone having 1.94 would want to download this tweek.  Wait for 1.95.

<P>Anyone downloading and using the new version must reinitiate their
WORD.MOD and WORD.MDV parameter files, if they are using such.



<P>As a safety precaution, the previous 1.93 version is continued on the site.

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
There is a <A HREF="word194w.exe"><B>WORD194W.EXE</B></A>,
a self-extracting EXE file
that the viewer can download as a binary file if his browser allows.

<P>This is a version
compiled on Windows 95 to run as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy Windows GUI.
The DOS version will also run in Windows 95, but the Windows version
has the advantage that it terminates gracefully
when run in the DOS partition of Windows 95.


<P>
The .EXE file, executed on your machine will produce about 5MB
of program and data files (and then may be discarded).
<P>
It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things together)
and copy the WORD194D.EXE into it, then run it in that subdirectory.

<P>The files created are:
<PRE>WORDS.EXE
INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.
UNIQUES.
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
WORDSDOC.HTM
WORDSDOC.TXT
</PRE>

The main program created is WORDS.EXE.  Run that
to do Latin-to-English word translations.  The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>The file WORDSDOC.TXT provides some documentation, and there is included
an HTML version which is also accessable on this site as
<A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<P>WORDS for Windows 95 runs on a IBM-compatible PC, running Windows 95
(and Windows 98 and NT).
WORDS is disk oriented, so a fast disk or caching helps.



<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS, with self-extractor:
<BR><BR><A HREF="mean194w.exe"><B>MEAN194W.EXE</B></A> for Windows 95/98/NT
<BR><BR>This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no
parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.
