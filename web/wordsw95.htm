<H1>WORDS - Version 1.96 for Windows 95
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the PC running Windows 95/98/NT. </H3>


<HR>
<P>12 September 2000 - New version 1.96 of the Windows WORDS
has been mounted as the regular distribution.



<P>As a safety precaution, the previous 1.95a version is continued on the site.

<HR>
<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>

<P>This is a version
compiled on Windows 95 to run as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy Windows GUI.
The DOS version will also run in Windows 95, but the Windows version
has the advantage that it terminates gracefully
when run in the DOS partition of Windows 95.

<P>
There are two files to be downloaded that the viewer can download
as binary files if his browser allows.
The program and the data are in two self-extracting files.
<BR><A HREF="disk1w95.exe"><B>DISK1W95.EXE</B></A>
<BR><A HREF="disk2w95.exe"><B>DISK2W95.EXE</B></A>

<P>The purpose of having two files is
is that individually they are less than the capacity of a 3 1/2" floppy,
so that you can copy them and pass them on to a friend who might not
have net capability.

<P>
These .EXE files, executed on your machine will produce about 12 MB
of program and data files (and then may be discarded).
<P>
It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things together)
and copy the .EXE into it, then run it in that subdirectory.

<P>The files created are:
<PRE>WORDS.EXE
MEANINGS.EXE

WORDS.HTM
WORDSW95.HTM
WORDSDOC.HTM

INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
WORDSDOC.HTM
WORDSW95.HTM
</PRE>

The main program created is WORDS.EXE.  Run thats
to do Latin-to-English word translations.  The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>The file WORDSDOC.HTM provides some documentation, and
is also accessible on this site as
<A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<P>WORDS for Windows 95 runs on a IBM-compatible PC, running Windows 95
(and Windows 98 and NT).




<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS, and it is available in the distribution.  Run this in the presence
of the dictionary files, just like WORDS.
This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no
parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that suppresses the dictionary form, let me know.
