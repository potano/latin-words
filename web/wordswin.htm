<H1>WORDS - Version 1.97FC for Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP <BR>
LATIN DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>
<P>

<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS Latin-to-English
and English-to-Latin dictionary program for the PC running Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP.  </H3>

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>

<P>
There in now only one self-extracting file to download, containing
both the program and the data.  Use your browser to download this file.
Click and save.
<BR>
<A HREF="197fcwin.exe"><B>197fcwin.exe</B></A> <BR>
<P>
This .EXE file, executed on your machine will produce about 21 MB of
program and data files (and then the ZIP may be discarded, but you may want to keep
it for a backup in case something happens to the program).
<P>
It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things
together) and copy the .EXE into it, then run it in that subdirectory.
<P>
The files created are:

<PRE>
WORDS.EXE
MEANINGS.EXE

WORDS.HTM
WORDSWIN.HTM
WORDSDOC.HTM


INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
EWDSEFIL.GEN
</PRE>

<P>Ther is a WORDS.ICO icon file for any who wish to use it.

<P>The main program is WORDS.EXE.  Run that to do Latin-to-English
word translations.  The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S
amo, amare, amavi, amatus   V
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>By entering ~E (tilde E then Enter/CR)you go the to English-to-Latin mode (~L returns to Latin)
which gives an output like this:.

<PRE><TT>=>love v

amo, amare, amavi, amatus  V     1 1 [XXXAO]
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;

diligo, diligere, dilexi, dilectus  V     3 1 [XXXAX]
select, pick, single out; love, value, esteem; approve, aspire to, appreciate;

ardeo, ardere, arsi, arsus  V     2 1 [XXXAO]
be on fire; burn, blaze; flash; glow, sparkle; rage; be in a turmoil/love;

adamo, adamare, adamavi, adamatus  V     1 1  TRANS   [XXXBO]
fall in love/lust with; love passionately/adulterously; admire greatly; covet;

deamo, deamare, deamavi, deamatus  V     1 1  TRANS   [XXXCO]
love dearly; be passionately/desperately in love with; be delighted with/obliged
</TT></PRE>

<P>
The file WORDSDOC.HTM provides some documentation, and is also accessible
on this site as <A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>
<P>
There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate for the
student to have access to the parsed forms information, but for which the
professor might allow simple meanings.  For this situation a modification
has been made producing a program called MEANINGS, and it is available in
the distribution.  Run this in the presence of the dictionary files, just
like WORDS.  This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>,
no parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so there is no way to output the
case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS that allows the temporary
suppression of this information.  It does allow the display of the
dictionary form, which seems to be appropriate and allowed for the
intended use.  If anyone requires a version that suppresses the dictionary
form, let me know.


<H4>OPERATING SYSTEMS</H4>
<P>
This is a version compiled on Windows to run as a console program
(keyboard entry).  It will run onWindows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP.
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without
fancy Windows GUI.  The DOS version will also run in Windows, but the
Windows version has the advantage that it terminates gracefully when run
in the DOS partition of Windows.


<P>
There is a quirk to viewing console/DOS-like programs on newer versions of
Windows.  While this is not necessary to run WORDS, there are those who
are more comfortable this way.  Remember to go to (change subdirectory to)
the subdirectory in which you have mounted the WORDS files.
<P>
Windows ME has changed the path to the MSDOS prompt to
<BR>
<B>Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;MSDOS</B>
<BR>
Go there and run WORDS and apparently everything works like DOS as before.
<BR>
For Windows 2000 the path to the prompt is
<BR>
<B>Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;Command Prompt </B>
<BR>
For Windows XP the path to the prompt is
<BR>
<B>Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;Command Prompt </B>
