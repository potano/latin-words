<H1>WORDS - Version 1.97E for Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP <BR>
LATIN DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>
<P>

<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS Latin-to-English
and English-to-Latin dictionary program for the PC running Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP.  </H3>

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>

<P>
There in now only one self-extracting file to download, containing
both the program and the data.  Use your browser to download this file.
Click and save.
<BR>
<A HREF="197EWIN.exe"><B>197EWIN.EXE</B></A> <BR>
<P>
This .EXE file, executed on your machine will produce about 19 MB of
program and data files (and then may be discarded).
<P>
It is usually good practice to make a subdirectory (to keep things
compact - 197EWIN self-unzips into C:\WORDS as default)
then run in that subdirectory.  To uninstall WORDS, just delete
the files and the folder.  There is no registery component for the
basic installation.
<P>
The 13 files created are:

<PRE>
WORDS.EXE
MEANINGS.EXE

WORDS.HTM
WORDSW95.HTM
WRDSDOC.HTM


INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
DICTFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
EWDSEFIL.GEN

and an icon
SPQR.ICO
</PRE>

The main program created is WORDS.EXE.  Run that to do Latin-to-English
word translations.  The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S
amo, amare, amavi, amatus   V
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>By entering &gt;E you go the to English-to-Latin mode (&gt;L returns to Latin)
which gives an output like this:.

<PRE><TT>=>love v

amo, amare, amavi, amatus  V     1 1 [XXXAO]
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;

diligo, diligere, dilexi, dilectus  V     3 1 [XXXAX]
select, pick, single out; love, value, esteem; approve, aspire to, appreciate;

ardeo, ardere, arsi, arsus  V     2 1 [XXXAO]
be on fire; burn, blaze; flash; glow, sparkle; rage; be in a turmoil/love;

</TT></PRE>

<P>
The file WORDSDOC.HTM provides some documentation, and is also accessible
on this site as <A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>
<P>
There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate for the
student to have access to the parsed forms information, but for which the
professor might allow simple meanings.  For this situation a modification
has been made producing a program called MEANINGS, and it is available in
the distribution.  Run this in the presence of the dictionary files, just
like WORDS.  This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>,
no parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so there is no way to output the
case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS that allows the temporary
suppression of this information.  It does allow the display of the
dictionary form, which seems to be appropriate and allowed for the
intended use.  If anyone requires a version that suppresses the dictionary
form, let me know.


<H4>OPERATING SYSTEMS</H4>
<P>
This is a version compiled on Windows to run as a console program
(keyboard entry).  It will run onWindows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP.
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without
fancy Windows GUI.  The DOS version will also run in Windows 95, but the
Windows version has the advantage that it terminates gracefully when run
in the DOS partition of Windows 95.


<P>
There is a quirk to viewing console/DOS-like programs on newer versions of
Windows.  While this is not necessary to run WORDS, there are those who
are more comfortable this way.  Remember to go to (change subdirectory to)
the subdirectory in which you have mounted the WORDS files.
<P>
Windows ME has changed the path to the MSDOS prompt to
<BR>
<B>Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;MSDOS</B>
<BR>
Go there and run WORDS and apparently everything works like DOS as before.
<BR>
For Windows 2000 the path to the prompt is
<BR>
<B>Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;Command Prompt </B>
<BR>
For Windows XP the path to the prompt is
<BR>
<B>Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;Command Prompt </B>



<H4>HISTORY</H4>
<P>
19 Janurary 2005 - Some corrections to 1.97E of the Windows WORDS has been mounted.
While you might not see the difference, it may be worth reloading.
<P>
December 2004 - New version 1.97E of the Windows WORDS has been mounted as
the regular distribution.
<P>
The main improvement is an English-to-Latin phase, invoked by ~E or ~e
(January symbol, Initially it was >E, then ^E).

<P>
The dictionary how has 37000 entries, including a significant increase
in medieval and modern Latin.
