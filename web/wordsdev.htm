<H1>WORDS - Version 1.95a
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM
<BR>DEVELOPERS/REHOSTERS PAGE</H1>

<P>
<H3>This page provides the Ada source code for a
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the PC, and the dictionary material sufficient to re-host.
<BR>Instructions below.</H3>

<HR>
<P>25 April 2000 Version 1.95a released.
<BR>The dictionary is somewhat larger than 1.95
<BR>It has somewhat improved output for complex meanings

<P>The 1.95 characteristics are continues
<BR>It can discriminate on the basis of AGE or FREQ, rejecting unlikely
results if there are more common ones.  Controlling parameters are introduced.
Check the defaults for youe particular application.
<BR>Some output (qui) may be a bit better.
<BR>One procedure (LIST_LIST) has been added.  It is used by LIST_PACKAGE.



<HR>
<H3>The WORDS System</H3>
<P>
There is a <A HREF="wordsall.zip"><B>WORDSALL.ZIP</B></A>
zip of all the Ada source files for WORDS, and support programs
and data to generate the necessary dictionaries and inflections
for re-hosting the WORDS Latin-to-English word parsing/translation
system on any machine with an Ada 95 compiler.
(It can be made to work with Ada 83 also by replacing the driver routine.)


<P>This a console program (keyboard entry), without fancy Windows GUI,
and is thereby system independent.


<HR>
<P>

<P>
The process is to download the WORDSALL.ZIP and unzip into a suitable
subdirectory.  (If the zip form is unsuitable for your system, I can
provide the files in an uncompressed form.)  The wordy file names
are for compliance with the restrictions of the GNAT system.  They may
be renamed, and I can provide an alternative.  However, the long file
names demand an UNZIP that preserves them, if GNAT is to be used.

For example, in a GNAT environment (one would maximally optimize the
main program):

<PRE>
gnatmake -O3 words
gnatmake makedict
gnatmake makestem
gnatmake makeinfl
</PRE>
<P>
This produces executables for WORDS, MAKEDICT, MAKESTEM, and MAKEINFL.
Executing the latter three against the input respectively of
<PRE>
DICTLINE.GEN
STEMLIST.GEN
INFLECTS.
</PRE>
<P>
(when they ask for DICTIONARY say G) produces
<PRE>
DICTFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
INFLECTS.SEC
</PRE>
<P>
Along with ADDONS. and UNIQUES., this is the set of data for WORDS.

<P>
The only problem that has appeared on porting so far is that one must
be careful of file names.  WORDS uses several files that it calls by name,
among these are ADDONS. and UNIQUES.  These names are set in
LATIN_FILE_NAMES and can be changed, but they are at any one time fixed.
There have been difficulties in the transfer to another system in losing
the period.  These have been problems in transfer, not in either source
or target system, and have been easily rectified by inspection.
All of my systems are case-independent on file names.  If one
is running in a case-dependent system (UNIX), this is a point to check.
Note that the data files are capitalized, source files are not.
