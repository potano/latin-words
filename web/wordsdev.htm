LATIN DICTIONARY PROGRAM <BR>
DEVELOPERS/REHOSTERS PAGE</H1>
<P>
<H2>WORDSALL and TOOLS</H2>
<P>
<H3>This page provides the Ada source code for a Latin dictionary
program for the PC, and the dictionary material sufficient to re-host
to other systems.
<BR>
Instructions below:  </H3>

<H3>
The WORDS System</H3>
<P>
There is a <A HREF="wordsall.zip"><B>wordsall.zip</B></A>
zip of all the Ada source files to port WORDS, and
support programs and data to generate the necessary dictionaries and
inflections for re-hosting the WORDS Latin dictionary
parsing/translation system on any machine with an Ada 95 compiler.  (It
can be made to work with Ada 83 also by replacing just the short driver routine.)
<P>
This a console program (keyboard entry), without fancy Windows GUI, and has
thereby been made system independent.
<P>
WORDSALL contains the Ada source files for WORDS

<PRE>
strings_package.ads
strings_package.adb

<P>
four supporting programs

<PRE>
makedict.adb
makestem.adb
makeinfl.adb

</PRE>

<P>
and DOS ASCII data files for them to act upon to produce WORDS data files

<PRE>
DICTLINE.GEN
STEMLIST.GEN
EWDSLIST.GEN
INFLECTS.LAT
</PRE>

<P>
the other WORDS DOS ASCII supporting files

<PRE>
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
</PRE>

<P>
<P>
The process is to download the 197ESALL.ZIP (case sensitive) and unzip into a
subdirectory.  (If the zip form is unsuitable for your system, I can
provide the files in an uncompressed form.) The wordy file names are for
compliance with the restrictions of the GNAT system.  They may be renamed,
and I can provide an alternative.  However, the long file names demand an
UNZIP that preserves them, if GNAT is to be used.

<P>For example, in a GNAT
environment (one would maximally optimize the main program):

<PRE>
gnatmake -O3 words
gnatmake makedict
gnatmake makestem
gnatmake makeefil
gnatmake makeinfl
</PRE>

<P>
This produces executables for WORDS, MAKEDICT, MAKESTEM, MAKEEFIL, and MAKEINFL.
Executing the latter four against the input respectively of

<PRE>
DICTLINE.GEN
STEMLIST.GEN
EWDSLIST.GEN
INFLECTS.LAT
</PRE>

<P>
(when they ask for DICTIONARY say G) producing

<PRE>
DICTFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
EWDSFILE.GEN
INFLECTS.SEC
</PRE>

<P>
Along with ADDONS.LAT and UNIQUES.LAT, this is the set of data for WORDS.
<P>
The only problem that has appeared on porting so far is that one must be
careful of file names.  Problems sometimes turn up but have been easily
rectified by inspection.  All of my systems are case-independent on file
names.  If one is running in a case-dependent system (UNIX), this is a
point to check.  Note that the data files are capitalized, source files
are not.



<P>The source is in Ada and therefore very readable, which is not claimed for the
logic which is my. not Ada's, fault.  The source and data are freely available
for anyone to use for any purpose.  It may be converted to other
languages, used in pieces, or modified in any way without further permission
or notification.

<P>There is one oddity that the reader may remark upon.  The code is loaded
with PUT/print statements which are now commented out.   These were used at
some time for debug purposes and were just left in.  They (mostly) are left
justified and may fairly easily be removed for a cleaner presentation.
Further there are many blocks of code which during development have been
moved or removed, but have in their previous place been left commented.
This is also messy.  I cannot really justify not having fixed this, but there it is.

<H3>Recent Versions</H3>

<P><B>August 2005 - Version 1.97Ed last release.</B>
This is just 1.97E with some corrections prompted by user feedback.
The dictionary is somewhat larger - 38000.
There is very little algorithm growth.

<P><B>March 2005 - Version 1.97Ec release.</B>
This is just 1.97E with some corrections prompted by user feedback.
There is no significant algorithm or vocabulary growth, but the
changes are worth the reload.

<P>December 2004 - Version 1.97E release.
New version has increased dictionary to 37000 entries,
including more ecclesiastical, medieval, and modern Latin.
Most of the increase was supplied by John White.
There is now a primitive English-to-Latin capability.
Changes in parameters and defaults will require users to reset mode files.

<P><B>Feburary 2004 - Over one million total hits on this site.</B>

<HR>
<P>
13 July 2002 - Version 1.97 still - This very slight update of the code
and a very few more entries in the dictionary.  It now takes two
RETURN/ENTERs to quit the program.  The only significant improvement is an
attempt to regularize the dictionary.  Most a/an/the articles have been
removed, especialy from the begining of a meaning.  Round () and square []
brackets are now uniform in application.  <BR>
<P>
1 Janurary 2002 - Version 1.97 still - This very slight update of the code
is to correct a few horrible mistakes, which apparently have no real
affect.  This is just for form, and to mark a date.  Any new compile
should use this version, but no one should go out of his way, unless you
have discovered the presence of these errors.  (Some DICT.LOC entries may
fail.  Some special cases in listing of dictionary around UNKNOWN may
raise exception.)

<P>
31 August 2001 - Version 1.97 - Update concentrates on improving
presentation of results to the user.  There are no significant
improvements to the algorithms, which seem to be quite stable now.  The
dictionary is now over 30000 entries, with some increase in late and
medieval Latin.
<P>
The main thrust of this version is to simplify the presentation for the
average student.  There is now a lot of (default) TRIMming.
This is to make the program more friendly to student users.
Uncommon/untimely parses are suppressed when there is a much more
common/likely solution.  Vocatives and locatives are often suppressed.
Where such TRIMming has occured, an asterix (*) follows the output.  The
user can cut out the TRIM by setting a # parameter, and this has been made
easier by placing that parameter first in the # menu.  The dictionary now
contains more than 30000 entries.
<P>
The file list_list has been renamed list_sweep, and put_example_line has
been removed from list_package to stand alone.  .LAT has been added as an
extension to those data files previously without extension.

<P>
15 October 2000 - Version 1.96 still - Some small changes as a result of
user feedback.  A few errors that crept into the latest version causing
words previously handled to raise exception were fixed.  There is no
change in the dictionary.  The changes are corrections and do not amount
to a new version, even a subversion.  The new code may be recognized by
successful handling of the word <B>quempiam</B>&quot;. (Thanks DiLaura)

<P>
10 September 2000 - Version 1.96 - a small change to the user.  <BR>
Somewhat larger dictionary - additions in medieval and ecclesiastical - I
hope for additional in the near future.  One reading the Vulgate will not
be disappointed.  <BR>
There is little algorithmic change, but considerable altering and renaming
or date structures.  This is completely invisible to the user, and
essentially invisible to developers, but it makes it important that there
be a new version number.
<P>
25 April 2000 Version 1.95a released.  <BR>
The dictionary is somewhat larger than 1.95 <BR>
It has somewhat improved output for complex meanings
<P>
The 1.95 characteristics are continued and: <BR>
It can discriminate on the basis of AGE or FREQ, rejecting unlikely
results if there are more common ones.  Controlling parameters are
introduced.  Check the defaults for youe particular application.  <BR>
Some output (qui) may be a bit better.  <BR>
One procedure (LIST_LIST) has been added.  It is used by LIST_PACKAGE.

<H3>
TOOLS</H3>
<P>
There is a <A HREF="tools.zip"><B>TOOLS.ZIP</B></A>
zip of a number of simple text tools (in Ada) used in preparation of WORDS.
Thses are mostly trivial, but could be helpful to one working with WORDS.
There is a brief HOWTO text which is far from complete.  I may do better
in the next version.
