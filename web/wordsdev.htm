<H1>WORDS - Version 1.97
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM
<BR>DEVELOPERS/REHOSTERS PAGE</H1>

<P>
<H3>This page provides the Ada source code for a
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the PC, and the dictionary material sufficient to re-host.
<BR>Instructions below.</H3>

<P>1 Janurary 2002 - Version 1.97 still - This very slight update of
the code is to correct a few horrible mistakes, which apparently
have no real affect.  This is just for form, and to mark
a date.  Any new compile should use this version, but no one
should go out of his way, unless you have discovered the presence
of these errors.  (Some DICT.LOC entries may fail.  Some special cases
in listing of dictionary around UNKNOWN may raise exception.)


<P>30 August 2001 - Version 1.97 - The only significant change is in
the presentation of the output.  There is now a lot of (default) TRIMming.
This is to make the program more friendly to student users.  Uncommon/untimely
parses are suppressed when there is a much more common/likely solution.
Vocatives and locatives are often suppressed.  Where such TRIMming
has occured, an asterix (*) follows the output.  The user can cut
out the TRIM by setting a # parameter, and this has been made easier
by placing that parameter first in the # menu.  The dictionary now
contains more than 30000 entries.

<P>The file list_list has been renames list_sweep, and put_example_line
has been removed from list_package to stand alone.  .LAT has been
added as an extension to those data files previously without extension.

<P>15 October 2000 - Version 1.96 still - Some small changes as a result
of user feedback.  A few errors that crept into the latest version
causing words previously handled to raise exception were fixed.  There
is no change in the dictionary.  The changes are corrections and do not
amount to a new version, even a subversion.  The new code may be recognized
by successful handling of the word "<B>quempiam</B>".  (Thanks DiLaura)

<P>10 September 2000 - Version 1.96 - a small change to the user.
<BR>Somewhat larger dictionary - additions in medieval and ecclesiastical -
I hope for additional in the near future.
One reading the Vulgate will not be disappointed.

<BR>There is little algorithmic change, but considerable altering and
renaming or date structures.  This is completely invisible to the user,
and essentially invisible to developers,
but it makes it important that there be a new version number.

<HR>
<P>25 April 2000 Version 1.95a released.
<BR>The dictionary is somewhat larger than 1.95
<BR>It has somewhat improved output for complex meanings

<P>The 1.95 characteristics are continued and:
<BR>It can discriminate on the basis of AGE or FREQ, rejecting unlikely
results if there are more common ones.  Controlling parameters are introduced.
Check the defaults for youe particular application.
<BR>Some output (qui) may be a bit better.
<BR>One procedure (LIST_LIST) has been added.  It is used by LIST_PACKAGE.



<HR>
<H3>The WORDS System</H3>
<P>
There is a <A HREF="wordsall.zip"><B>WORDSALL.ZIP</B></A>
zip of all the Ada source files for WORDS, and support programs
and data to generate the necessary dictionaries and inflections
for re-hosting the WORDS Latin-to-English word parsing/translation
system on any machine with an Ada 95 compiler.
(It can be made to work with Ada 83 also by replacing the driver routine.)


<P>This a console program (keyboard entry), without fancy Windows GUI,
and is thereby system independent.


<HR>
<P>
WORDSALL contains the Ada source files for WORDS

<B>(Please note that the data files now with extension .LAT used to have
just a final period in these filenemes.
Some systems had trouble dropping the final period when copying,
so the names were changes.)</B>


<HR>

<P>
The process is to download the WORDSALL.ZIP and unzip into a suitable
subdirectory.  (If the zip form is unsuitable for your system, I can
provide the files in an uncompressed form.)  The wordy file names
are for compliance with the restrictions of the GNAT system.  They may
be renamed, and I can provide an alternative.  However, the long file
names demand an UNZIP that preserves them, if GNAT is to be used.

For example, in a GNAT environment (one would maximally optimize the
main program):

<PRE>
gnatmake -O3 words
gnatmake makedict
gnatmake makestem
gnatmake makeinfl
</PRE>
<P>
This produces executables for WORDS, MAKEDICT, MAKESTEM, and MAKEINFL.
Executing the latter three against the input respectively of
<PRE>
DICTLINE.GEN
STEMLIST.GEN
INFLECTS.LAT
</PRE>
<P>
(when they ask for DICTIONARY say G) produces
<PRE>
DICTFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
INFLECTS.SEC
</PRE>
<P>
Along with ADDONS.LAT and UNIQUES.LAT, this is the set of data for WORDS.

<P>
The only problem that has appeared on porting so far is that one must
be careful of file names.  Problems sometimes turn up but
have been easily rectified by inspection.
All of my systems are case-independent on file names.  If one
is running in a case-dependent system (UNIX), this is a point to check.
Note that the data files are capitalized, source files are not.
