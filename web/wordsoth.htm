a presentation comparable to a basic paper dictionary.  This page is set up

especially for those unable to run the full

<A HREF="freq.htm">THE FREQUENCY OF LATIN WORDS AND THEIR ENDINGS</A>
by PAUL BERNARD DIEDERICH

<P>This1939 thesis of Paul Diederich addresses the frequency of Latin words
as releted to teaching elementary Latin.  It is the basis of the frequency
selections in Wheelock's Latin Grammar, but it is not easily available.
While machine scans may have made hand work old hat, this study deserves to be
preserved.
