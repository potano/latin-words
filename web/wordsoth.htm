<H4>DICTPAGE</H4>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/whitaker/dictpage.htm"><B>DICTPAGE</B></A>
is a simple listing or wordlist of the Latin dictionary used by the WORDS program,
a presentation comparable to a basic paper dictionary.  This page is set up
in HTML to be read by any browser.  The presentation is
especially for those unable to run the full
<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm"><B>WORDS</B></A> program.

<P>This is deliberately a large (4 MB) monolithic file, rather than one broken into
pieces for easy access over the net.  While it certainly can be used on-line
to look up a single word, it is expected that the user will want to download
the entire file for continuing use on his machine.
<P>
A clean and simple version (1 MB) of the data in this file,
suitable for processing for various purposes, is given in ZIP form in
<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/whitaker/dictpage.zip"><B>dictpage.zip</B></A>.


<P>
<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/whitaker/listall.zip"><B>LISTALL</B></A>
is a simple zipped listing of all Latin words that can be generated with the
dictionary and inflections.  It is alphabetical, one copy of each unique form.
This file was produced following several requests by people who wanted this
to use in conventional spellcheckers.

<P>This is a bare bones capability since it does not include the possibility
of word formation with prefixes, suffixes, and tricks.  It does not of itself
even recognize the -que enclitic which can be added to most any Latin word.
The preferred WORDS method of spellchecking is to run WORDS and check the
UNKNOWNS, the logical equivalant of conventional spellchecking, but much more
powerful.

<A HREF="freq.htm">THE FREQUENCY OF LATIN WORDS AND THEIR ENDINGS</A>
by PAUL BERNARD DIEDERICH

<P>This1939 thesis of Paul Diederich addresses the frequency of Latin words
as releted to teaching elementary Latin.  It is the basis of the frequency
selections in Wheelock's Latin Grammar, but it is not easily available.
While machine scans may have made hand work old hat, this study deserves to be
preserved.

<P>
There is a strange story associated with this posting.
As the document clearly states, and as supported by all academic
citations of this work, it was published by the University of
Chicago Press.  I wrote there to get permission to distribute this
thesis.  They denied any knowledge of the document!  I wrote back
and argued, they denied again, and even a third time.  So, while I
do not have their permission, I certainly have enough evidence to
prevent them from suing me over it.
