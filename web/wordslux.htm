<H1>WORDS - Version 1.97 for Linux/FreeBSD (i386) <BR>
LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>
<P>


<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS Latin-to-English
dictionary program for the PC running Linux.  </H3>
<P>
The same program also runs under FreeBSD 3.2 with the adjustments cited
below.  Note while initially the library changes in FreeBSD 3.4 gave
trouble, the program now runs without problem under FreeBDC-3.4-STABLE and
FreeBSD 4.0 and 4.1.
<P>
<B>There is now a native FreeBSD.  (see below)</B>
<P>


<H3>Downloading the WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
There is a file at the Thomas Aquinas FTP site
<A HREF="ftp://petrus.thomasaquinas.edu/pub/linux/words/words-1.97-linux.tar.gz">
<B>words-1.97 -linux.tar.gz</B></A>
(1.6MB), that the viewer can download as a binary file if his browser
allows.
<P>
A short
<A HREF="ftp://petrus.thomasaquinas.edu/pub/linux/words/README">
<B>README </B></A> file comes with
the download with more detailed installation/execution instructions.  You
are encouraged to read this here on-line before downloading.
<P>
This version was produced by <A HREF="mailto:bdragoo@thomasaquinas.edu"> <B>Brian Dragoo</B></A> of Thomas Aquinas College in
California.  It was compiled on RedHat Linux (i386) to run as a console
program (keyboard entry).  It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented,
without fancy GUI.
<P>
 The .tar.gz file, uncompressed on your machine, will produce about 8MB of
program and data files (and then may be discarded).  The main program
created is <I>words</I>.  Run that to do Latin-to-English word translations.
Given an input of amo, the output looks like this:

<PRE><B><TT>
=>amat
am.at            V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 3 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus    V
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></B></PRE>

<P>
The file WORDSDOC.TXT provides some documentation, and there is included
an HTML version, which is also accessable directly on the present site as <A HREF="http://users.erols.com/whitaker/wordsdoc.htm"><B>
WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.  This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS
program.
<P>
WORDS for Linux runs any Linux distribution.
<P>
There is also a small shell script that takes care of a slight problem in
executing the program.  <B><I>words</I></B> must be run from the directory with the
supporting files.  So the shell script simply changes directories to the
words directory, executes <B><I>words</I></B>, then changes back to the previous
directory after <B><I>words</I></B> has exited.  See the
<B><A HREF="ftp://petrus.thomasaquinas.edu/pub/linux/words/README">README</A></B> for
further details.

<B>alternate download</B></A> has been provided by James Quinby.


<HR>

<H3>Running LINUX code under FreeBSD</H3>
<P>
The Linux code will run under FreeBSD, or try the native Free BSD below.
The only modification for the Linux code is is how one can setup Linux
mode on a FreeBSD machine.  This will work with FreeBSD-3.2 and
FreeBSD-3.4-STABLE.
<P>
1) Install linux_lib-2.6.1 in /usr/ports/emulators/linux_lib : make
install
<P>
2) Edit /etc/rc.conf line: linux_enable=YES <BR>
Matt Heckaman reports that it runs great on FreeBSD 4.0 and 4.1 with
linux_base-6.1 port installed (/usr/ports/emulators/linux_base).

<H3>Native
FreeBSD</H3>
<P>
Philip Paeps has a <A HREF="http://www.paeps.cx/words/words-1.97-freebsd4-i386.tar.gz"><B>FreeBSD package</B></A>, compiled on FreeBSD 4.7-PRERELEASE for
an i386.  The package is in .tar.gz form.  <!---->
