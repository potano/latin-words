<H1>WORDS - Version 1.95a for Linux (i86)
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the PC running Linux. </H3>
<P>The same program also runs under FreeBSD 3.2
with the adjustments cited below.
Note while initially the library changes in FreeBSD 3.4 gave trouble,
the program now runs without problem under FreeBDC-3.4-STABLE
and FreeBSD 4.0 and 4.1 .

<P>
<H3>Downloading the WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
There is a file at the Thomas Aquinas FTP site
<A HREF="ftp://petrus.thomasaquinas.edu/pub/linux/words-1.95a-linux.tar.gz">
<B>words-1.95a-linux.tar.gz</B></A> (1.6MB),
that the viewer can download as a binary file if his browser allows.

<P>A short README file <A HREF="readme.lux"><B>README.LUX</B></A> comes
with the download with more detailed
installation/execution instructions.
You are encouraged to read this here on-line before downloading.


<P>This version was produced by Brian Dragoo
<A HREF="mailto:bdragoo@thomasaquinas.edu"> <B>(E-mail)</B></A>
of Thomas Aquinas College in California.
It was compiled on RedHat Linux to run as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy GUI.



<P>
The .tar.gz file, uncompressed on your machine, will produce about 8MB
of program and data files (and then may be discarded).
The main program created is <I>words</I>.  Run that
to do Latin-to-English word translations.
Given an input of amo, the output looks like this:

<PRE><B><TT>=>amat
am.at            V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 3 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></B></PRE>

<P>The file WORDSDOC.TXT provides some documentation, and there is included
an HTML version, which is also accessable directly on the present site as
<A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<P>WORDS for Linux runs on a IBM-compatible PC, running RedHat Linux
(and presumably other versions).



<P>There is also a small shell script that takes care of a
slight problem in executing the program.  <B><I>words</I></B> must be run
from the directory with the supporting files.  So the shell script, which
resides in /usr/bin, and is itself executable, simply changes directories to the words directory,
executes <B><I>words</I></B>, then changes back to the previous directory
after <B><I>words</I></B> has exited.

<HR>
<H3>Running under FreeBSD</H3>

<P>The only modification is how one can setup Linux mode on a FreeBSD machine.
This will work with FreeBSD-3.2 and FreeBSD-3.4-STABLE.

<P>1) Install linux_lib-2.6.1 in /usr/ports/emulators/linux_lib : make
install
<P>2) Edit /etc/rc.conf line: linux_enable=YES

Matt Heckaman reports that it runs great on FreeBSD 4.0 and 4.1 with
linux_base-6.1 port installed (/usr/ports/emulators/linux_base).
