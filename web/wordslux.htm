<H1>WORDS - Version 1.94 for Linux (i86)
<BR>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM</H1>


<P>
<H3>This page provides instructions for downloading the WORDS
Latin-to-English dictionary program
for the PC running Linux. </H3>


<HR>


<P>
<H3>Downloading the WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
There is a file at the Thomas Aquinas FTP site
<A HREF="ftp://petrus.thomasaquinas.edu/pub/linux/words-1.94-linux.tar.gz">
<B>words-1.94-linux.tar.gz</B></A> (1.3MB),
that the viewer can download as a binary file if his browser allows.


<P>This version was produced by Brian Dragoo
<A HREF="mailto:bdragoo@thomasaquinas.edu"> <B>(E-mail)</B></A>
of Thomas Aquinas College in California.
It was compiled on RedHat Linux to run as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy GUI.



<P>
The .tar.gz file, uncompressed on your machine, will produce about 6MB
of program and data files (and then may be discarded).
The main program created is <I>words</I>.  Run that
to do Latin-to-English word translations.
Given an input of amo, the output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>

<P>The file WORDSDOC.TXT provides some documentation, and there is included
an HTML version, which is also accessable directly on the present site as
<A HREF="wordsdoc.htm"><B>WORDSDOC.HTM</B></A>.
This is stand-alone, it is not callable from the WORDS program.

<P>WORDS for Linux runs on a IBM-compatible PC, running RedHat Linux
(and presumably other versions).



<P>A README file comes with the download with more detailed
installation/execution instructions once you get the download.

<P>There is also a small shell script that takes care of a
slight problem in executing the program.  <B><I>words</I></B> must be run
from the directory with the supporting files.  So the shell script, which
resides in /usr/bin, and is itself executable, simply changes directories to the words directory,
executes <B><I>words</I></B>, then changes back to the previous directory
after <B><I>words</I></B> has exited.
