<H1>LATIN-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM <BR>WORDS - Version 1.97Ed</H1>

<P>
<H3>Download a free Latin-English-Latin dictionary program for your PC or MAC.</H3>

<P>
<P><B>August 2005 - Somewhat better Version 1.97Ed release.</B>
This is just 1.97Ed with more corrections prompted by user feedback
and another 1000 entries in the dictionary.
There is no significant algorithm growth.

<P>
This Latin dictionary program, (WORDS for the PC - DOS, Windows
95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP, OS/2, LINUX - and Mac OS X - console version), takes
keyboard input or a file of Latin text lines and provides an
analysis/morphology (declension, conjugation, case, tense, etc.) of each
word individually, the dictionary form, and the translation (meaning).

<PRE><B><TT>
am.at           V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 3 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;
</TT></B></PRE>

<P>
There is an English-to-Latin phase, invoked by ~E or ~e (tilde E).
<PRE><B><TT>
love v

amo, amare, amavi, amatus  V     1 1 [XXXAO]
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;

diligo, diligere, dilexi, dilectus  V     3 1 [XXXAX]
select, pick, single out; love, value, esteem; approve, aspire to, appreciate;
</TT></B></PRE>

<P>
The dictionary contains over 38000 entries and, through additional word
construction with hundreds of prefixes and suffixes, may generate more,
leading to many hundreds of thousands of 'words' that can be formed by
declension and conjugation.  Present emphisis is on classical Latin and
late Latin, but medieval Latin entries are increasing.  WORDS provides a
tool to help in translations for the Latin student and a memory jog for
researchers.

<P>
This version has been considerably enhanced in neo/modern Latin,
by including, with his kind permission,
the Melissa Calepinus Novus dictionary of Guy Licoppe.
<P>
The program source (in Ada) and dictionary are freely available for
rehosting.

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
WORDS runs on all systems as a console program (keyboard entry).  It runs
like the DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy Windows GUI.
<P>
 Run WORDS to do Latin-to-English word translations.  The output looks like
this:

<P>
The codes for inflections are in the documentation, however it is expected
that the user will have had at least a few weeks of introductory Latin in
order to be able to interpret the results beyond the simple meaning.

<H4>
MEANINGS ONLY</H4>
<P>
There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate for the
student to have access to the parsed forms information, but for which the
professor might allow simple meanings.  For this situation a modification
has been made producing a program called MEANINGS for each host.  This is
a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no parsing of the
word.  It is hard-coded so there is no way to output the case/tense, as
opposed to the option in WORDS that allows the temporary suppression of
this information.  It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which
seems to be appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone
requires a version that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.  <BR>
<BR>


<H4>DEVELOPERS AND REHOSTERS</H4>
<P>
The source program is in Ada and very system independent.  While I just
have compiled executables for the PC, it should be possible to rehost the program
on any machine with an Ada compiler.  Some have requested the Ada source
code for this purpose and there is now a fairly simple set of files that
should allow this.  Beside PCs, it has been put on DEC, SUN and SGI systems, at least.
For developers and for porting, or anyone interested in using parts of WORDS, copy the
<A HREF="wordsdev.htm"><B>WORDS system source</B></A>, code, data, and tools.
This is freely available without restriction.

John White has produced a commercial PC program,
<A HREF=http://www.software-partners.co.uk/index.php?sitesig=SP&page=SP_03_latin_translation>
<B>Blitz Latin</B></A>, using the
WORDS dictionary but goes further and translates sentences, not just
separate words.

<P>
Roger Pearse has written a commercial Windows program
<A HREF="http://www.quicklatin.com/"><B>QuickLatin</B></A>.
This also uses the Words dictionary and algorithms and includes logic to help
with understanding clauses and sentences, and not just individual words.

<P>
Perry Rapp is developing
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/getverba/verba.html"><B>Verba</B></A>,
a local dictionary program to translate
single words from Latin to English, from Spanish to English, or from
English to Spanish, and also markup texts in html.  It uses the WORDS data
files for the Latin option.

<P>
Mike Polis has a Tcl/Tk program called
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/mfp_99/glossator.html"><B>Glossator</B></A>
using the WORDS dictionary, but not the program.
This should work on the MAC, as well as Windows 95 and Linux.

<P>
Michael Cumming has used WORDS output in constructing his
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/paris/rue/9963/"> <B>
Caesar Machine</B></A>.

<P>
There is a
<A HREF="http://douay.mrklingon.org"> <B>Bible site</B></A>
developed by Joel Peter Anderson using WORDS to
process the Vulgate.  At this website you can call up a Vulgate passage.
When it comes up, each line of text is a link to the words.exe at Notre
Dame.  Clicking the link brings up your output in a new window.

<P>
Some WORDS output was used for Latin fables by <A HREF="http://www.iclub.lv/dainis/"><B>Dainis Zeps</B></A>.

An entirely independent downloadable program with similiar goals to WORDS,
but translating to French, can be found at

<P>
Another MAC program, including several languages, is available from
<A HREF="http://www.lindesay.co.nz/page_wordlookup.shtml"><B>Andrew

An almost impossible problem is covered admirably in <A HREF="http://asgle.classics.unc.edu/abbrev/latin/"><B>Abbreviations in

The competition to WORDS is the
<A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/enggreek?"><B>Perseus</B></A>

<P>
<B>I am not a Latin scholar, only a dictionary hacker</B>
(in the old sense of one building with only an ax doe a tool).
While I try to reply
to all messages and do the best I can, do not expect much in the way of
translations from me, not anything that I (and you) cannot get from the
program.  And I am not qualified to even try English-to-Latin.

<P>I get a couple of hundred spam and virus driven messages every day
and so the weeding process is quite vicious.
I am sure that I lose good messages,
so keep at me and make sure the subject line is clear and unambiguous.

<P>If you have some questions about the program, or a word that it does not
find, I will do what I can.  My response tine is very slow these days.
If you do not get an answer, feel free to pulse me.
