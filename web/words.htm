<P><H2><B>17 March 2003- PERSONAL DISASTER</B></H2>
<P><B>My development.web machine self-destructed.  While the WORDS source and
dictionaries were safe, I lost a lot, including all my addresses and mail files.
I spent many hundreds of dollars with three different commercial firms trying to recover,
to no avail.  I have been essentially "off the air" for almost two months.
If you have tried to contact me and have not heard back, please try anew.
If we had unfinished business, please e-mail me.  I have lost all records, even your name!

<B>Now available for the Mac OS X and for OS/2</B>
<P>
WORDS does work on Windows ME, 2000, and XP.  See download page.
<P>
There is a
<A HREF="http://douay.mrklingon.org"> <B>Bible site</B></A>
developed by Joel Peter Anderson using WORDS to
process the Vulgate.  At this website you can call up a Vulgate passage.
When it comes up, each line of text is a link to the words.exe at Notre

<P>
This Latin dictionary program, (WORDS for the PC - DOS, Windows
95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP, OS/2, LINUX - and Mac OS X - console versions), takes
keyboard input or a file of Latin text lines and provides an
analysis/morphology (declension, conjugation, case, tense, etc.) of each
word individually, the dictionary form, and the translation (meaning).

<PRE><B><TT>
am.at           V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 3 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;
</TT></B></PRE>

<P>
The dictionary contains over 30000 entries and, through additional word
construction with hundreds of prefixes and suffixes, may generate more,
leading to many hundreds of thousands of 'words' that can be formed by
declension and conjugation.  Present emphisis is on classical Latin and
late Latin, but medieval Latin entries are increasing.  WORDS provides a
tool to help in translations for the Latin student and a memory jog for
researchers.
<P>
The program source (in Ada) and dictionary are freely available for
rehosting.

I regret that there is no program for the MAC.  However, there is a
<A HREF="dictpage.txt"><B>
DICTPAGE.TXT</B></A> text file of the dictionary that my be downloaded and
searched locally, without the parsing provided by the program.  It looks
much like a paper Latin dictionary, except that the Latin principal parts
are capitalized to be used in a case-sensitive search.  For 1.97, the
order is that of the WORDS DICTLINE, alphabetic on stems, but not always
exactly alphabetic on expanded entry.  If you do not find your word.  look
around a bit.
<BR>
There are a couple of MAC programs using the dictionary.  See the LINKS at
the end of this page.

<H3>Recent Versions</H3>
<P>
15 September 2001 - Linux and DOS versions upgrades to WORDS 1.97.
<P>
31 August 2001 - Version 1.97 - Update concentrates on improving
presentation of results to the user.  There are no significant
improvements to the algorithms, which seem to be quite stable now.  The
dictionary is now over 30000 entries, with some increase in late and
medieval Latin.
<P>
The main thrust of this version is to simplify the presentation for the
average student.  Trimming has been greatly expanded so as to hide
possible parses which are unlikely in popular classical texts and student
exercises.  The full parse (archaic, medieval, rare, etc.) is still
available by switching the TRIM paramenter, and that operation has been
made more convenient by siting that first in the # parameter list.
<P>
15 October 2000 - Version 1.96 still - Some small changes as a result of
user feedback.  A few errors that crept into the latest version causing
words previously handled to raise exception were fixed.  There is no
change in the dictionary.  The changes are corrections and do not amount
to a new version, even a subversion.  The new code may be recognized by
successful handling of the word <B>quempiam</B>&quot;. (Thanks DiLaura)
<P>
10 September 2000 - Version 1.96 - a small change to the user.  <BR>
Somewhat larger dictionary - additions in medieval and ecclesiastical - I
hope for additional in the near future.  One reading the Vulgate will not
be disappointed.
<P>


<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>
<P>
WORDS runs on all systems as a console program (keyboard entry).  It runs
like the DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy Windows GUI.
<P>
 Run WORDS to do Latin-to-English word translations.  The output looks like
this:

<P>
The codes for inflections are in the documentation, however it is expected
that the user will have had at least a few weeks of introductory Latin in
order to be able to interpret the results beyond the simple meaning.

<H4>
MEANINGS ONLY</H4>
<P>
There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate for the
student to have access to the parsed forms information, but for which the
professor might allow simple meanings.  For this situation a modification
has been made producing a program called MEANINGS for each host.  This is
a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>, no parsing of the
word.  It is hard-coded so there is no way to output the case/tense, as
opposed to the option in WORDS that allows the temporary suppression of
this information.  It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which
seems to be appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone
requires a version that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.  <BR>
<BR>


<H4>DEVELOPERS AND REHOSTERS</H4>
<P>
The source program is in Ada and very system independent.  While I just
have executables for the PC, it should be possible to rehost the program
on any machine with an Ada compiler.  Some have requested the Ada source
code for this purpose and there is now a fairly simple set of files that
should allow this.  It has been put on DEC, SUN and SGI systems, at least.

<B>I am not a Latin scholar, only a dictionary hacker.  </B> While I try to reply
to all messages and do the best I can, do not expect much in the way of
translations from me, not anything that I (and you) cannot get from the
program.  And I am not qualified to even try English-to-Latin.
<P>
If you have some questions about the program, or a word that it does not
find, I will do what I can.  I try to answer promptly (24 hours).  If you
do not get an answer, feel free to pulse me.  Please check the return
address on your message.  I seem to get an unusual number of messages in
which the return is not set properly and the answer bounces back with No
Such Address.
