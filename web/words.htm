<P>A particularly interesting application/use of WORDS is at

<P>Some WORDS output was used for Latin fables by

<H4>19 October - Release of version 1.95</H4>
<P>The dictionary upgrade has only gotten through COQ.
But about 2000 entries in the latter parts have been added.

<P>Trimming now means someting.  If TRIM_OUTPUT parameter is set,
and specific parameters set in the MDEV, the program will disparage
those possible forms which come from archaic or medieval (non-classical)
stems or inflections, also stems or inflections which are relatively uncommon.
It will report such if no classical/common solutions are found.
The default is set for this, expecting that most users are students and
unlikely to encounter rare forms.  Other users can set the parameters
appropriately for their situation.
<P>This capability is preliminary.  It
is just becoming useful in that the factors are set
for about half the dictionary entries.  There are still a large number
of entries and inflections that are not set and will continue to
be reported until determination of rarity is made.

<P>There are pointers
to separate download and information pages for each operating system.
<P>See the particular page for each specific system.

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>

<P>WORDS runs on all systems as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like the DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy Windows GUI.


<P>
Run WORDS to do Latin-to-English word translations.
The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>=>amo
am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>





<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS for each host.
This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>,
no parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.

<H4>DEVELOPERS AND REHOSTERS</H4>

<P>The source program is in Ada and very system independent.  While I just
have executables for the PC, it should be possible to rehost the program
on any machine with an Ada compiler.  Some have requested the Ada source
code for this purpose and there is now a fairly simple set of files that
should allow this.

Feedback is invited.  If there is a problem in installing or operating,
in the results or their display, or if your favorite word is omitted
from the dictionary, let me know.

<BR>PLEASE comment and check back for new versions releases.

<P>I am not a Latin scholar, only a dictionary hacker.  While I
try to reply to all messages and do the best I can, do not expect
much in the way of translations from me,
nor anything that I (and you) cannot get from the program.

<P>
I try to answer promptly.  If you do not get an answer, please check the
return address on your message.  I seem to get an unusual number of messages
in which the return is not set properly and the answer bounces back with
"No Such Address".
