<H1>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM
<BR>"WORDS" - Version 1.95a</H1>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Download a free
Latin-English dictionary program for the PC.</H3>


<P>This Latin dictionary program,
(WORDS for the PC - DOS, Windows 95 or LINUX console versions),
takes keyboard input or a file of Latin text lines and provides
an analysis/morphology (declension, conjugation, case, tense, etc.)
of each word individually, the dictionary form, and the translation (meaning).

<PRE><B><TT>am.at           V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 3 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;
</TT></B></PRE>


<P>The dictionary contains over 27000 entries and,
through additional word construction with hundreds of prefixes and suffixes,
may generate more, leading to many hundreds of thousands of 'words' that
can be formed by declension and conjugation.
Present emphisis is on classical Latin and late Latin,
but medieval Latin entries are increasing.
WORDS provides a tool to help in translations for the Latin
student and a memory jog for researchers.

<P>The program source (in Ada) and dictionary are freely available for rehosting.

<P>A Net interactive version of WORDS is at

<H3>Recent Versions</H3>

<P>25 April 2000 - Version 1.95a - a small improvement over 1.95.
<BR>Somewhat larger dictionary
<BR>Improved looking output for entries with several lines of meaning
<BR>There is no significant algorithmic change

<P>There are insufficient changes to call this with a new number, so the 'a'
has been added.

<P>The DOS version has not been implemented at this time.

<HR>
<P>19 October 1999 - previous Version 1.95 released



<HR>
<H3>Version 1.95a</H3>



<P>The dictionary reexamination has now gotten through DEM.
There are now 27000 entries.

<P>Begining with 1.95, trimming means something.
If TRIM_OUTPUT parameter is set,
and specific parameters set in the MDEV, the program will disparage
those possible forms which come from archaic or medieval (non-classical)
stems or inflections, also stems or inflections which are relatively uncommon.
It will report such if no classical/common solutions are found.
The default is set for this, expecting that most users are students and
unlikely to encounter rare forms.  Other users can set the parameters
appropriately for their situation.

<P>This capability is preliminary.  It
is just becoming useful in that the factors are set
for about half the dictionary entries.  There are still a large number
of entries and inflections that are not set and will continue to
be reported until determination of rarity is made.

<P>
<HR>
<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>

<P>WORDS runs on all systems as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like the DOS program, line-oriented, without fancy Windows GUI.


<P>
Run WORDS to do Latin-to-English word translations.
The output looks like this:

<P>The codes for inflections are in the documentation, however it is expected
that the user will have had at least a few weeks of introductory Latin in order
to be able to interpret the results beyond the simple meaning.


<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS for each host.
This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>,
no parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that supresses the dictionary form, let me know.

<H4>DEVELOPERS AND REHOSTERS</H4>

<P>The source program is in Ada and very system independent.  While I just
have executables for the PC, it should be possible to rehost the program
on any machine with an Ada compiler.  Some have requested the Ada source
code for this purpose and there is now a fairly simple set of files that
should allow this.  It has been put on SUN and SGI systems, at least.

<H4>LINLKS</H4>

<P>The Net interactive version of WORDS is at
<A HREF="http://lysy2.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe"><B>Notre Dame</B></A>.

<P>A Windows 95 graphical interface has been generated by
<A HREF="http://www.quicklatin.com/">
<B>Roger Pearse</B></A>.

<P>Some WORDS output was used for Latin fables by
<A HREF="http://www.iclub.lv/dainis/"><B>Dainis Zeps</B></A>.

<P>Mike Polis has a Tcl/Tk program called
<A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/mpolis/glossator.html"><B>Glossator</B></A>
using the WORDS dictionary, but not the program.  This should work
on the MAC, as well as Windows 95 and Linux.

<P>Perseus has a net look-up for
<A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/enggreek?">
<B>English-to-Latin</B></A> based on Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary,
as well as Latin-to-English.

<P>An entirely independent downloadable program with similiar goals to WORDS,
but translating to French, can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.collatinus.com/"><B>Collatinus</B></A>

<P>A downloadable MAC lexicon (no forms) by
<A HREF="http://king.tidbits.com/matt/LatinDictReadMe.html">
<B>Matt Neuburg</B></A>
using Peter N Lewis' ObiWan, based on 15600 entry Cassell's dictionary.

<P>An almost impossible problem is covered admirably in
<A HREF="http://asgle.classics.unc.edu/abbrev/latin/">
<B>Abbreviations in Latin Inscriptions</B></A> by Tom Elliott.

Feedback is invited.  If there is a problem in installing or operating,
in the results or their display, or if your favorite word is omitted
from the dictionary, let me know.

<BR>PLEASE comment and check back for new versions releases.

<P>I am not a Latin scholar, only a dictionary hacker.  While I
try to reply to all messages and do the best I can, do not expect
much in the way of translations from me,
not anything that I (and you) cannot get from the program.

<P>
I try to answer promptly (24 hours).  If you do not get an answer,
please check the return address on your message.
I seem to get an unusual number of messages
in which the return is not set properly and the answer bounces back with
"No Such Address".
