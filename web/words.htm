<H1>LATIN-to-ENGLISH DICTIONARY PROGRAM
<BR>"WORDS" - Version 1.95a</H1>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>This page provides for downloading a
Latin-to-English dictionary program for the PC.</H3>


<P>This program, (WORDS for the PC - DOS, Windows 95 or LINUX
console versions),
takes keyboard input or a file of Latin text lines and provides
an analysis of each word individually.

<PRE><TT>am.o             V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 1 S X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to
</TT></PRE>


<P>The dictionary contains over 27000 entries and,
through additional word construction with hundreds of prefixes and suffixes,
may generate more, leading to many hundreds of thousands of 'words' that
can be formed by declension and conjugation.
Present emphasis is on classical and late Latin, but medieval Latin entries
are increasing.
WORDS provides a tool to help in translations for the Latin
student and a memory aid for serious researchers.

<P>The program source (Ada) and dictionary are available for rehosting.

<P>25 April 2000 - Version 1.95a - a small improvement over 1.95.
<BR>Somewhat larger dictionary
<BR>Improved looking output for entries with several lines of meaning
<BR>Insufficient algorithmic changes to call this a new number, so the 'a'
has been added.

<P>Only the Windows 95/98/NT version has been updated to 'a' at this time.

<P>19 October 1999 - previous Version 1.95 released

<H3>WORDS - Version 1.95a</H3>



<P>The dictionary reexamination has now gotten through DEM.
There are now 27000 entries.

<P>Beginning with 1.95, trimming means something.
If TRIM_OUTPUT parameter is set,
and specific parameters set in the MDEV, the program will disparage
those possible forms which come from archaic or medieval (non-classical)
stems or inflections, also stems or inflections which are relatively uncommon.
It will report such if no classical/common solutions are found.
The default is set for this, expecting that most users are students and
unlikely to encounter rare forms.  Other users can set the parameters
appropriately for their situation.

<P>This capability is preliminary.  It
is just becoming useful in that the factors are set
for about half the dictionary entries.  There are still a large number
of entries and inflections that are not set and will continue to
be reported until determination of rarity is made.

<P>There are separate download and information pages for each operating system.
<P>See the particular page for your specific system.

<H3>The WORDS Program</H3>

<P>WORDS gives the morphology, dictionary form, and meaning of input
Latin words.  While several words can be input on a single line, each
is analyzed and reported individually.  There is no translation of sentences.

<P>WORDS runs on all systems as a console program (keyboard entry).
It runs like a DOS program, line-oriented, without a Windows GUI.


<P>
Run WORDS to do Latin-to-English word translations.
The output looks like this:

<PRE><TT>portas
port.as            N      1 1 ACC P F T
porta, portae
gate, entrance; city gates; door; avenue;
port.as            V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 2 S X
porto, portare, portavi, portatus
carry, bring;

arcarum
arc.arum           N      1 1 GEN P F T
arca, arcae
box, chest; strong-box, coffer; wealth, money; coffin, bier; cell, cage; ark;
ark (Noah's); Ark of the Covenant;
quadrangular landmark for surveyors;

amarunt
Syncopated perfect often drops the 'v' and contracts vowel - likely
amav.erunt         V      1 1 PERF ACTIVE  IND 3 P X
amo, amare, amavi, amatus
love, like; fall in love with; be fond of; have a tendency to;</TT></PRE>

<P>A full explanation of the forms and codes is contained in the
documentation.

<H4>MEANINGS ONLY</H4>

<P>There are academic situations in which it would be inappropriate
for the student to have access to the parsed forms information, but
for which the professor might allow simple meanings.  For this
situation a modification has been made producing a program called
MEANINGS for each host.
This is a version that is crippled to output <B>ONLY MEANINGS</B>,
no parsing of the word.  It is hard-coded so
there is no way to output the case/tense, as opposed to the option in WORDS
that allows the temporary suppression of this information.
It does allow the display of the dictionary form, which seems to be
appropriate and allowed for the intended use.  If anyone requires a version
that suppresses the dictionary form, let me know.

<H4>DEVELOPERS AND REHOSTERS</H4>

<P>The source program is in Ada and very system independent.  While I just
have executables for the PC, it should be possible to rehost the program
on any machine with an Ada compiler.  Some have requested the Ada source
code and dictionary files for this purpose and
there is now a fairly simple set of files that
should allow this.  It has been put on SUN and SGI systems, at least.

<P>I am not a Latin scholar, only a dictionary hacker.  While I
try to reply to all messages and do the best I can, do not expect
much in the way of translations from me,
not anything that I (and you) cannot get from the program.

<P>
I try to answer promptly (24 hours).  If you do not get an answer,
please check the return address on your message.
I seem to get an unusual number of messages
in which the return is not set properly and the answer bounces back with
"No Such Address".
